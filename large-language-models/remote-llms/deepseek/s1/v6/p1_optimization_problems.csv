1,Linear Programming,LP,Objective function and constraints are all linear. The most fundamental and widely applied type.,Efficiently solvable (Simplex, Interior-Point). Global optimum guaranteed.,Product mix optimization, diet problem.,10
2,Mixed-Integer Linear Programming,MILP,An LP problem where some decision variables are constrained to be integers.,NP-Hard. Solution time grows exponentially with number of integers. Good solvers (e.g., CPLEX, Gurobi) exist for many cases.,Facility location, scheduling, vehicle routing.,9
3,Convex Optimization,CONVEX,A special class of nonlinear problems where the objective is convex and constraint set is convex.,Efficiently solvable (for many cases). Global optimum guaranteed.,Portfolio optimization (with certain risk models), parameter estimation.,8
4,Quadratic Programming,QP,Objective function is quadratic (and often convex) and constraints are linear.,Efficiently solvable if the quadratic objective is convex (e.g., Portfolio optimization).,Portfolio optimization (Markowitz model), least squares regression.,7
5,Non-Linear Programming,NLP,Objective function or constraints are non-linear. The broadest category.,Generally difficult. Often only local (not global) optima can be found for non-convex problems.,Process engineering, economic modeling.,6
6,Constraint Programming,CP,Focuses on finding feasible solutions satisfying a set of constraints (objective may be secondary).,NP-Hard. Uses powerful propagation and search techniques.,Sudoku, scheduling, puzzles.,5
7,Stochastic Programming,SP,Optimization under uncertainty. Parameters are known only by their probability distributions.,Computationally very challenging. Often solved via sampling (e.g., SAA) or decomposition.,Energy planning, supply chain under demand uncertainty.,4
8,Robust Optimization,RO,Seeks solutions that are immune to data uncertainty within a predefined uncertainty set.,Often reformulated as a deterministic (e.g., LP, SOCP) problem, which can be solvable.,Portfolio optimization with worst-case risk.,3
9,Dynamic Programming,DP,Problems can be broken down into simpler, overlapping subproblems. Not a specific formulation but a solution method.,Can suffer from the "curse of dimensionality". Efficiency depends on problem structure.,Shortest path problems, inventory management, resource allocation.,2
10,Combinatorial Optimization,CO,Involves finding an optimal object from a finite set of objects. Often modeled as MILP.,NP-Hard for most interesting problems. Relies on heuristics and exact algorithms.,Traveling Salesman Problem, Knapsack Problem.,1
