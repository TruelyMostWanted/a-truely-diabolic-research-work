ID,Name,Description,AffectedEntities,Influence
1,Unrealistic Sprint Commitments,Commitment to an excessive amount of work in a sprint, often due to external pressure. This creates a constant fear of failure.,Development Team,10
2,Vague or Changing Requirements,Poorly defined user stories or frequent mid-sprint changes in scope ("scope creep") without adjusting the timeline. This leads to confusion, rework, and frustration.,Development Team, Product Owner,9
3,Technical Debt & Legacy Code,Being forced to work with a brittle, poorly documented codebase. This slows down progress immensely and makes every change a high-risk endeavor.,Development Team,9
4,Micro-Management,Lack of autonomy where team members are not trusted to make technical decisions or manage their own work. This undermines the core Scrum principle of self-organization.,Development Team,8
5,Continuous Context Switching,Constant interruptions, being pulled into multiple projects, or responding to urgent production issues. This prevents deep work and kills productivity.,Development Team,8

12,Uncertainty & Lack of Vision,A product roadmap that changes constantly or is not communicated, making the team's work feel pointless or directionless.,Entire Team,6
