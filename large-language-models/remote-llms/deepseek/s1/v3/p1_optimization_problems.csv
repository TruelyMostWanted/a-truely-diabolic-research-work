1,Linear Programming,LP,Optimize a linear objective function subject to linear equality and inequality constraints. The most fundamental and widely taught type.,Efficiently solvable (P),Resource allocation, diet problem,10
2,Mixed-Integer Linear Programming,MILP,An LP where some or all decision variables are constrained to be integers. Adds combinatorial complexity.,NP-Hard, generally difficult. Solvable for many practical instances with modern solvers.,Scheduling, facility location,9
3,Convex Optimization,CONVEX,Minimize a convex objective function over a convex set. A broad class with very favorable properties.,Efficiently solvable for many subclasses (P),Portfolio optimization (with certain risk measures), machine learning model training,8
4,Nonlinear Programming,NLP,Optimize a nonlinear objective function subject to nonlinear constraints. A very broad and difficult class.,Generally NP-Hard. Difficulty highly dependent on problem structure.,Engineering design, chemical process optimization,7
5,Quadratic Programming,QP,A special case of NLP where the objective function is quadratic and constraints are linear.,Efficiently solvable if the objective is convex (P). NP-Hard if indefinite.,Portfolio optimization (Markowitz model),8
6,Constraint Satisfaction Problem,CSP,Find an assignment of values to variables that satisfies a given set of constraints, without an explicit objective function.,NP-Complete in general, but often tractable.,Sudoku, circuit design, scheduling,6
7,Stochastic Programming,SP,Optimization under uncertainty. Parameters are known only by their probability distributions.,Extremely computationally challenging.,Planning under uncertain demand, financial planning,5
8,Robust Optimization,RO,Seeks solutions that are feasible for the worst-case realization of uncertain parameters within a defined set.,Often leads to tractable problems (e.g., LPs, SOCPs), but can be conservative.,Aircraft scheduling with uncertain weather,4
9,Dynamic Programming,DP,A method for solving complex problems by breaking them into simpler subproblems. It is a principle, not a problem type.,Varies, but often efficient for problems with optimal substructure.,Shortest path problems, inventory management,3
10,Combinatorial Optimization,CO,A field concerned with problems where the set of feasible solutions is discrete or can be reduced to discrete. MILP is a primary technique.,Inherently NP-Hard in most cases.,Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), graph coloring,2
