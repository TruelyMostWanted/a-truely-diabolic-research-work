1,Linear Programming,LP,Objective function and constraints are all linear. The workhorse of optimization.,Efficiently solvable (e.g., Simplex, Interior-Point).,Resource allocation, diet problem.,10
2,Mixed-Integer Linear Programming,MILP,An LP problem where some decision variables are required to be integers.,NP-Hard. Solution time grows exponentially with number of integers.,Scheduling, facility location, vehicle routing.,9
3,Nonlinear Programming,NLP,Objective function or constraints are nonlinear.,Varies widely. Can be very difficult to solve globally.,Engineering design, parameter estimation.,8
4,Convex Optimization,CO,A subclass of NLP where the objective is convex and constraint set is a convex set.,Efficiently solvable to a global optimum.,Portfolio optimization (some forms), machine learning.,7
5,Quadratic Programming,QP,Objective function is quadratic and constraints are linear. A special case of NLP.,Efficiently solvable if the Q matrix is positive semi-definite (convex).,Portfolio optimization, model predictive control.,6
6,Constraint Programming,CP,Focuses on finding feasible solutions satisfying complex logical constraints.,NP-Hard. Uses powerful propagation and search techniques.,Scheduling, puzzles (e.g., Sudoku).,5
7,Stochastic Programming,SP,Optimization under uncertainty. Parameters are known only by their probability distributions.,Computationally intensive. Often requires sampling.,Planning with uncertain demand, supply chain risk.,4
8,Robust Optimization,RO,Seeks solutions that are immune to data uncertainty within a predefined uncertainty set.,Often leads to tractable formulations (e.g., LP, SOCP).,Logistics with uncertain travel times.,3
9,Dynamic Programming,DP,Solves complex problems by breaking them into simpler subproblems and storing their solutions.,Can suffer from the "curse of dimensionality".,Inventory management, shortest path problems.,2
10,Multi-Objective Optimization,MOOP,Involves multiple conflicting objectives to be optimized simultaneously.,No single optimal solution; finds a set of Pareto-optimal solutions.,Product design (cost vs. performance), environmental policy.,1
