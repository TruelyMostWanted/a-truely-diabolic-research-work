1,Linear Programming,LP,Objective function and constraints are all linear. The most fundamental and widely applied type.,Efficiently solvable (e.g., Simplex, Interior-Point).,Maximize profit given resource constraints (e.g., product mix).,10
2,Mixed-Integer Linear Programming,MILP,An LP where some decision variables are required to be integers.,NP-Hard. Solution time grows exponentially with number of integer variables.,Scheduling (integer: yes/no decisions), Facility Location (integer: open/close).,9
3,Convex Optimization,CONVEX,Objective function is convex, and feasible set is a convex set.,Efficiently solvable for many subclasses.,Portfolio Optimization (minimize risk for given return).,8
4,Quadratic Programming,QP,Objective function is quadratic, and constraints are linear. A subclass of convex optimization.,Efficiently solvable if the QP is convex.,Portfolio Optimization (with risk-return trade-off).,7
5,Nonlinear Programming,NLP,Objective function or constraints are nonlinear.,Generally difficult (NP-Hard). Solvability depends heavily on problem structure.,Engineering design, chemical process optimization.,6
6,Constraint Programming,CP,Focuses on satisfying a set of constraints on discrete variables. Good for feasibility problems.,NP-Complete. Relies on powerful propagation and search techniques.,Scheduling, puzzles (e.g., Sudoku), logic problems.,5
7,Stochastic Programming,SP,Optimization under uncertainty. Parameters are known only by their probability distributions.,Computationally challenging. Often requires sampling or decomposition.,Energy planning with uncertain demand.,4
8,Robust Optimization,RO,Seeks solutions that are immune to data uncertainty within a predefined uncertainty set.,Often leads to tractable problems (e.g., LP, SOCP).,Portfolio optimization that protects against worst-case scenarios.,3
9,Dynamic Programming,DP,Problem is broken down into simpler subproblems. Solutions to subproblems are stored and reused.,"Curse of dimensionality." Efficient for problems with optimal substructure.,Shortest path problems, inventory management.,2
10,Multi-Objective Optimization,MOO,Involves multiple, often conflicting, objective functions.,No single optimal solution. Yields a set of Pareto-optimal solutions.,Designing a car to be both fast and fuel-efficient.,1
