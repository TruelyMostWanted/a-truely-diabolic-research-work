ID,Name,Description,AffectedEntities,Influence
1,Unrealistic Sprint Commitments,Commitment to an excessive amount of work in a sprint, often due to external pressure or misestimation. This creates a constant fear of failure.,Development Team, Product Owner,10
2,Constantly Changing Priorities (Scope Creep),The Product Backlog is volatile, with priorities shifting dramatically during a sprint. This invalidates current work and creates frustration and a feeling of wasted effort.,Development Team, Scrum Master,9
3,Lack of Psychological Safety,Team members fear speaking up about problems, asking "stupid" questions, or challenging decisions. This leads to hidden impediments and unchecked errors.,Development Team, Scrum Master,9
4,Vague or Poorly Defined Requirements,User Stories that lack clear acceptance criteria or are open to interpretation. This leads to rework, misunderstandings, and conflict during the Sprint Review.,Development Team, Product Owner,8
5,Technical Debt & Legacy Code,Working in a codebase that is brittle, untested, and hard to modify. Every change becomes a high-risk, stressful endeavor, slowing progress to a crawl.,Development Team,8
6,Micro-Management & Lack of Autonomy,Developers are not trusted to make technical decisions or organize their own work. This undermines the core SCRUM principle of self-organization and creates resentment.,Development Team,7
7,Continuous Context Switching,Being pulled into unrelated meetings, asked to handle production incidents, or work on multiple backlog items simultaneously. This destroys deep focus and productivity.,Development Team,7
8,Ineffective Daily Scrums,The Daily Stand-up becomes a status report for the Scrum Master/PO instead of a planning meeting for developers. It feels punitive and adds no value.,Development Team,6
9,Unaddressed Impediments,Impediments raised by the team are not resolved in a timely manner by the Scrum Master or organization. This creates feelings of helplessness and frustration.,Development Team, Scrum Master,6
10,Unclear Definition of "Done",The team has no shared, rigorous understanding of what it means for a backlog item to be complete. This leads to last-minute chaos and "undone" work piling up.,Development Team,5
11,Distracting & Noisy Environment,Open office plans or constant notifications (Slack, Email) that prevent developers from achieving a state of flow, which is crucial for complex problem-solving.,Development Team,5
12,Lack of Necessary Skills/Training,Being assigned tasks without the requisite knowledge or skills, leading to anxiety, slow progress, and dependence on others.,Individual Developers,5
13,Ineffective Retrospectives,Retrospectives are skipped, become complaint sessions, or result in no actionable improvements. The team feels their problems are ignored.,Development Team, Scrum Master,4
14,Pressure from "Velocity" as a Metric,Velocity is used as a performance metric for individuals or the team, rather than a planning tool. This encourages gaming the system and discourages honesty.,Development Team,4
