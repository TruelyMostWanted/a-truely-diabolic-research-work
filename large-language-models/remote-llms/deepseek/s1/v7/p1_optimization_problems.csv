10,Linear Programming,LP,Optimize a linear objective function subject to linear equality and inequality constraints. The decision variables are continuous.,Easy (Polynomial time). Highly efficient solvers exist.,Diet Problem, Resource Allocation,10
9,Mixed-Integer Linear Programming,MILP,An LP problem where some decision variables are constrained to be integers. This adds combinatorial complexity.,Hard (NP-Hard). Solution time can grow exponentially, but modern solvers are very powerful.,Scheduling, Facility Location,9
8,Convex Optimization,-,A broad class of problems where the objective function is convex and the constraint set is a convex set. Local minima are global minima.,Generally easy for many subclasses (e.g., QP, SOCP) with efficient algorithms.,Portfolio Optimization (with certain models), Machine Learning Training,8
7,Quadratic Programming,QP,Optimize a quadratic objective function subject to linear constraints. A subclass of Convex Optimization if the Hessian is PSD.,Easy (Polynomial time) if convex. Harder if non-convex.,Portfolio Optimization (Markowitz),8
6,Nonlinear Programming,NLP,Optimize a nonlinear objective function subject to nonlinear constraints. The most general form.,Very Hard. No universal efficient algorithm. Solutions are often local, not global.,Chemical Process Design, Engineering Design,7
5,Constraint Programming,CP,A paradigm for solving combinatorial problems by defining constraints between variables. Focuses on feasibility and logical constraints.,Powerful for feasibility and highly combinatorial problems with specific constraint types.,Sudoku, Scheduling, Rostering,6
4,Stochastic Programming,SP,Optimization under uncertainty. Parameters are modeled using random variables with known probability distributions.,Very Challenging. Problems often become extremely large when scenarios are enumerated.,Energy Planning, Supply Chain under Demand Uncertainty,5
3,Robust Optimization,RO,Optimization under bounded uncertainty. Seeks solutions that are feasible for all realizations of the uncertain data within a defined set.,Challenging, but often tractable. Leads to deterministic, though potentially larger, reformulations.,Portfolio Optimization with uncertainty sets,5
2,Dynamic Programming,DP,A method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is both a modeling and solution paradigm.,Varies. Can be efficient for problems with optimal substructure, but can suffer from the "curse of dimensionality".,Shortest Path Problems, Inventory Management,4
1,Multi-Objective Optimization,-,Problems with multiple, often conflicting, objective functions. There is no single optimal solution, but a set of Pareto-optimal solutions.,Challenging. Requires specialized algorithms to approximate the Pareto front.,Product Design (cost vs. performance), Environmental Policy,3
