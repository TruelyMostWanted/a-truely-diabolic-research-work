1,Linear Programming,LP,Optimize a linear objective function subject to linear equality and inequality constraints. The most fundamental and widely applied type.,Efficiently solvable (e.g., Simplex, Interior-Point). Optimal solution guaranteed.,Resource allocation, diet problem, production planning.,10
2,Mixed-Integer Linear Programming,MILP,An LP where some or all decision variables are constrained to be integers. Adds combinatorial complexity.,NP-Hard in general. Solved with Branch & Bound, Cutting Planes. Solution time can grow exponentially.,Scheduling, facility location, vehicle routing with discrete choices.,9
3,Convex Optimization,CONVEX,Minimizing a convex objective function over a convex set. A broad class that includes LPs, QPs, and others.,Efficiently solvable (gradient descent, etc.). Any local minimum is a global minimum.,Portfolio optimization (without integer constraints), parameter fitting.,8
4,Quadratic Programming,QP,Optimize a quadratic objective function subject to linear constraints. A subclass of convex optimization.,Efficiently solvable if the objective is convex (e.g., Interior-Point methods).,Portfolio optimization (with risk), least squares regression.,7
5,Non-Linear Programming,NLP,Optimize a non-linear objective function subject to non-linear constraints. The most general form.,Extremely difficult in general. Solvers often find local, not global, minima. Heavily dependent on problem structure.,Engineering design, chemical process control.,6
6,Constraint Programming,CP,A programming paradigm where relations between variables are stated in the form of constraints. Excellent for feasibility problems and highly combinatorial problems.,NP-Complete. Solved with backtracking, constraint propagation. Strong for logical constraints.,Scheduling, puzzles (e.g., Sudoku), logic problems.,5
7,Stochastic Programming,SP,Optimization under uncertainty. Parameters are known only by their probability distributions. Models involve random variables.,Computationally intensive. Often requires generating and solving many scenarios.,Energy planning with uncertain demand, supply chain management with uncertain costs.,4
8,Robust Optimization,RO,A framework for optimization under uncertainty that seeks a solution that is feasible for all realizations of the data within a defined uncertainty set.,Typically leads to tractable, deterministic problems (often LPs, SOCPs, SDPs).,Portfolio optimization to guard against worst-case market movements.,3
9,Dynamic Programming,DP,A method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is both a modeling framework and an algorithm.,Solvability depends on the problem. Can suffer from the "curse of dimensionality".,Shortest path problems, inventory management, resource scheduling over time.,2
10,Multi-Objective Optimization,MOO,Problems involving more than one objective function to be optimized simultaneously. There is no single optimal solution, but a set of Pareto-optimal solutions.,No single "solution". Goal is to find or approximate the Pareto frontier.,Product design (maximize performance, minimize cost), project selection (maximize ROI, minimize risk).,1
