1,Linear Programming,LP,Optimize a linear objective function subject to linear equality and inequality constraints. The most fundamental and widely applied type.,Efficiently solvable (P),Product mix optimization,10
2,Mixed-Integer Linear Programming,MILP,An LP where some decision variables are constrained to be integers. Adds combinatorial complexity.,NP-Hard,Facility location,9
3,Nonlinear Programming,NLP,Optimize a nonlinear objective function subject to nonlinear constraints. A very broad category.,Varies widely (NP-Hard in general),Engineering design,8
4,Quadratic Programming,QP,A special case of NLP where the objective is quadratic and constraints are linear. Common in economics and finance.,Efficiently solvable if convex,Portfolio optimization,7
5,Constraint Programming,CP,Focus on finding feasible solutions that satisfy all constraints, often used for scheduling and puzzles.,NP-Hard,Employee scheduling,6
6,Integer Programming,IP,A special case of MILP where *all* decision variables are integers.,NP-Hard,Knapsack problem,5
7,Dynamic Programming,DP,Breaks a complex problem into simpler subproblems and solves them recursively. A method, not a problem type.,Varies,Shortest path algorithms,4
8,Stochastic Programming,SP,Optimization under uncertainty. Parameters are known only by their probability distributions.,Computationally challenging,Power grid management,3
