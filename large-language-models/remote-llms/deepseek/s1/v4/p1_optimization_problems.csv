1,Linear Programming,LP,Optimize a linear objective function subject to linear equality and inequality constraints. The decision variables are continuous.,Efficiently solvable (P). Global optimum guaranteed.,Resource allocation, diet problem,10
2,Mixed-Integer Linear Programming,MILP,An LP problem where some or all decision variables are restricted to integer values. Adds combinatorial complexity.,NP-Hard in general. Solution time grows exponentially with number of integer variables.,Scheduling, facility location,9
3,Quadratic Programming,QP,Optimize a quadratic objective function subject to linear constraints. A common subclass is convex QP.,Convex QP is efficiently solvable (P). Non-convex QP is generally NP-Hard.,Portfolio optimization (minimizing risk),8
4,Nonlinear Programming,NLP,Optimize a nonlinear objective function subject to nonlinear constraints. The most general form.,Extremely difficult. Often only local optima can be found for non-convex problems. Convex NLPs are solvable.,Chemical process design, engineering design,7
5,Constraint Programming,CP,Model problems with decision variables and constraints, but focus is on feasibility and logical constraints, not just an objective function. Variables can be non-numeric.,Powerful for feasibility problems. Solution methods (constraint propagation) are very different from MILP.,Scheduling, puzzles (Sudoku),6
6,Stochastic Programming,SP,Optimization under uncertainty. Parameters are random variables with known probability distributions. The objective often involves an expectation.,Computationally intensive. Requires knowledge of the underlying probability distribution or many samples.,Energy planning with uncertain demand,5
7,Robust Optimization,RO,Optimization under uncertainty where parameters are unknown but bounded within a defined uncertainty set. Aims for solutions that are feasible for all realizations in the set.,Computationally tractable for many problem classes (often reformulated as LP, SOCP, or SDP).,Portfolio optimization with worst-case scenario,4
8,Combinatorial Optimization,CO,A broad field focused on finding optimal solutions from a finite set of discrete objects. Problems are defined on graphs, sets, permutations, etc.,Generally NP-Hard. Requires specialized algorithms (exact and heuristic).,Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), Knapsack Problem,3
9,Dynamic Programming,DP,DP is a method, not a problem type. It breaks a complex problem into simpler subproblems and solves them recursively. Used for optimal decision-making over time.,Efficient for problems with optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems. "Curse of dimensionality" is a major limitation.,Shortest path problems, inventory management,2
10,Semidefinite Programming,SDP,A generalization of LP where the solution is a positive semidefinite matrix. Used in approximations for hard problems and in control theory.,Efficiently solvable with interior-point methods (P), though more complex than LP.,Max-cut approximations, system stability analysis,1
