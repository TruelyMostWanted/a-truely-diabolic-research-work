ID,Step,Description,Interval,Result
1,Project Vision Formulation,High-level definition of the project's goals, target audience, and core value proposition. Provides direction for all future work.,Once at project start, but can be refined.,Project Vision Statement
2,Product Backlog Creation,The Product Owner compiles an ordered list of all desired features, enhancements, and fixes, known as User Stories.,Once, but continuously updated and refined.,Prioritized Product Backlog
3,Release Planning,High-level plan outlining which features from the backlog are targeted for a specific release. Defines a rough timeline and goal.,Per Release (multiple Sprints).,Release Plan & Target Release Goal
4,Sprint Planning,The team selects a chunk of work from the top of the Product Backlog to complete in the upcoming Sprint. They break it down into tasks.,Every Sprint (e.g., every 2 weeks).,Sprint Goal and Sprint Backlog
5,Daily Scrum,A 15-minute time-boxed meeting for the Developers to synchronize work: What did I do? What will I do? Any impediments?,Daily, during a Sprint.,Synchronized team, identified blockers.
6,Development Work,The core activity of designing, implementing, and testing software. This is where coding, code review, and CI/CD pipelines are actively used.,Continuous, throughout the Sprint.,Increment of potentially shippable software.
7,Continuous Integration (CI),Developers frequently merge code changes into a shared repository. Each merge triggers an automated build and test process.,Continuous, multiple times per day.,Automated build verification, early bug detection.
8,Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD),Automatically deploying every change that passes all tests to a staging/production-like environment (Deployment) or making it ready for release (Delivery).,Continuous, after successful CI.,Code is always in a deployable state.
9,Sprint Review,An informal meeting at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment with stakeholders and gather feedback.,Every Sprint.,Adapted Product Backlog based on feedback.
10,Sprint Retrospective,A meeting for the team to inspect its own process: What went well? What could be improved? Create a plan for improvements.,Every Sprint.,Actionable improvement plan for the next Sprint.
11,Product Increment Release,Formally deploying the validated Increment from the Sprint to the production environment for users.,Per Release (can be every Sprint if CD is fully implemented).,Released software, value delivered to users.
12,Backlog Refinement,The ongoing process of reviewing, updating, and detailing items in the Product Backlog for future Sprints.,Ongoing, usually weekly within a Sprint.,Clear, detailed, and estimated backlog items.
13,Stakeholder Feedback Loop,The continuous cycle of gathering feedback from users and stakeholders on released features to inform future backlog items.,Continuous, after releases.,New User Stories and insights for the Product Backlog.
14,Production Monitoring & Operation,Monitoring the performance, stability, and usage of the released software in the live environment.,Continuous, after release.,Operational data, bug reports, performance metrics.
