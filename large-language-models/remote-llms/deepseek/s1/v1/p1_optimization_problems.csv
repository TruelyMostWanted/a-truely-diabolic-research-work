1,Linear Programming,LP,Optimization of a linear objective function subject to linear equality and inequality constraints. The most fundamental and widely applied type.,Efficiently solvable (P). Global optimum guaranteed.,Resource allocation, product mix, diet problem.,10
2,Mixed-Integer Linear Programming,MILP,A linear programming problem where some or all decision variables are restricted to integer values. Adds combinatorial complexity.,NP-Hard. Solution time can grow exponentially with size. Heuristics often used.,Scheduling, facility location, vehicle routing with discrete choices.,9
3,Convex Optimization,-,A broad class of problems where the objective function is convex and the constraint set is a convex set. LP is a subset.,Efficiently solvable (P). Global optimum guaranteed.,Portfolio optimization (with certain risk measures), parameter fitting.,8
4,Nonlinear Programming,NLP,Optimization where the objective function or constraints are nonlinear. A very broad category.,Difficulty varies wildly. Can be NP-Hard. Often only local optima are found.,Engineering design, chemical process control.,7
5,Constraint Programming,CP,A paradigm for solving combinatorial problems stated as sets of constraints over decision variables. excels at feasibility and logical constraints.,NP-Hard. Relies on powerful propagation and search techniques.,Scheduling, puzzles (e.g., Sudoku), logic problems.,6
6,Quadratic Programming,QP,A special case of NLP with a quadratic objective function and linear constraints. Common in finance and statistics.,Efficiently solvable if the objective is convex (P).,Portfolio optimization (mean-variance), least squares regression.,5
7,Stochastic Programming,SP,Optimization under uncertainty. Parameters are modeled using random variables with known probability distributions.,Computationally very challenging. Often requires sampling (e.g., SAA).,Planning under uncertain demand, supply chain risk management.,4
8,Robust Optimization,RO,Optimization under uncertainty seeking solutions that are feasible for all realizations of uncertain data within a predefined set.,Often leads to tractable (e.g., LP, SOCP) reformulations.,Designing systems immune to worst-case scenarios.,3
9,Dynamic Programming,DP,A method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is both a modeling framework and an algorithm.,Can suffer from the "curse of dimensionality".,Shortest path problems, inventory management, resource scheduling.,2
10,Multi-Objective Optimization,-,Problems with multiple, often conflicting, objective functions. The solution is not a single point but a set of Pareto-optimal trade-offs.,"Solvability" depends on the underlying problem type. Goal is to map the Pareto front.,Designing a product for both low cost and high performance.,1
