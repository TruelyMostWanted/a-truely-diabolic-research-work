Requirement Extraction,NLP Task,Uses text parsing and information retrieval to identify functional and non-functional requirements from unstructured documents (e.g., meeting notes, emails, specs).,Product Backlog, Product Owner
Named Entity Recognition (NER),NLP Technique,Identifies entities like "user", "payment", "admin", "API" in text to detect actors, actions, and system components in user stories.,User Stories, Product Backlog
Intent Detection,NLP Technique,Classifies the purpose of a sentence (e.g., "As a user I want to login" → authentication intent) to auto-categorize requirements.,User Stories, Backlog Refinement
Text Summarization,NLP Task,Generates concise summaries of long requirement documents or stakeholder feedback to support quick decision-making.,Product Owner, Sprint Review
Sentiment Analysis,NLP Technique,Analyzes feedback from Sprint Reviews or user interviews to detect satisfaction, frustration, or urgency.,Sprint Review, Product Owner
Complexity Estimation,NLP Application,Predicts story point complexity by analyzing vocabulary, sentence length, number of conditions (e.g., "if", "when"), and ambiguity in user story text.,Sprint Planning, Development Team
Dependency Parsing,NLP Technique,Analyzes grammatical structure to detect relationships between requirements (e.g., "after login, show dashboard" → dependency).,Backlog Refinement, Release Planning
Ambiguity Detection,NLP Application,Flags vague terms like "fast", "efficient", "soon" using lexicons or ML models to improve requirement clarity.,User Stories, Backlog Refinement
User Story Splitting,NLP Application,Suggests ways to decompose large user stories using clause separation or action clustering (e.g., splitting "register and verify email" into two tasks).,Backlog Refinement, Sprint Planning
Automated Tagging,NLP Application,Applies labels (e.g., "security", "performance", "UI") to backlog items based on keyword matching or topic modeling.,Product Backlog, Release Planning
Topic Modeling (e.g., LDA),NLP Technique,Discovers thematic clusters in large backlogs or feedback to support prioritization and feature grouping.,Product Backlog, Product Owner
Semantic Similarity,NLP Technique,Measures how similar two user stories are using embeddings (e.g., BERT), helping to detect duplicates or merge related items.,Backlog Refinement, Product Owner
Stakeholder Language Translation,NLP Application,Translates requirements written in natural language across languages to support global teams or multilingual stakeholders.,Product Owner, Scrum Team
Traceability Link Recovery,NLP Task,Establishes links between user stories, test cases, and code comments by matching semantic content.,Product Backlog, Testing, CI/CD
Effort Prediction Model,NLP + ML,Combines NLP-processed story text with historical data to predict development effort or sprint feasibility.,Sprint Planning, Development Team
Chatbot for Backlog Input,NLP Application,Allows stakeholders to submit requirements via chat; NLP parses and structures input into draft user stories.,Product Owner, Stakeholders
Readability Scoring,NLP Metric,Measures readability (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid) of user stories to ensure clarity and shared understanding.,User Stories, Scrum Team
Automated Acceptance Criteria Generation,NLP Application,Generates "Given-When-Then" scenarios from user stories using rule-based or generative models (e.g., T5, GPT).,User Stories, Testing
