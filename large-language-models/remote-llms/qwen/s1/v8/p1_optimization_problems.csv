1,Linear Programming,LP,Optimization problem with a linear objective function and linear constraints. Variables are continuous.,Polynomial time (e.g., Simplex, Interior Point),Maximize profit given resource constraints,10
2,Integer Programming,IP,Objective and constraints are linear, but variables must take integer values.,NP-hard,Production planning with discrete units,9
3,Mixed-Integer Linear Programming,MILP,Combines LP and IP: some variables are continuous, others are integers.,NP-hard,Scheduling with on/off decisions,8
4,Nonlinear Programming,NLP,Objective function or constraints are nonlinear. Variables are continuous.,Varies (local vs global),Optimal design of engineering systems,7
5,Convex Optimization,CO,Subclass of NLP where objective is convex (minimization) and feasible set is convex. Guarantees global optima.,Polynomial time (under conditions),Portfolio optimization with risk,6
6,Quadratic Programming,QP,Objective is quadratic, constraints are linear.,Polynomial time (if convex),Mean-variance portfolio optimization,5
7,Binary Programming,BP,Special case of IP where variables are restricted to 0 or 1.,NP-hard,Feature selection in machine learning,4
8,Dynamic Programming,DP,Method for optimizing over time using recursive decomposition.,Pseudo-polynomial time,Shortest path in a staged network,3
9,Combinatorial Optimization,COpt,Optimizing over discrete structures (graphs, permutations, sets).,Typically NP-hard,Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP),2
10,Stochastic Programming,SP,Objective or constraints involve random variables; optimizes expected outcomes.,Varies (often scenario-based),Supply chain under demand uncertainty,1
