ID,Name,Description,AffectedEntities,Influence
1,Sprint Time Pressure,Intense deadlines within short sprints (e.g., 2 weeks) create urgency and reduce room for error or exploration.,Development Team, Scrum Master,8
2,Unrefined Product Backlog,Poorly defined, ambiguous, or constantly changing backlog items increase uncertainty and mental load during planning and execution.,Development Team, Product Owner,9
3,Scope Creep During Sprint,Adding or changing requirements mid-sprint violates Scrum rules and disrupts focus, leading to frustration and overload.,Development Team,9
4,Unrealistic Velocity Expectations,Management or Product Owner pushing teams to exceed historical velocity without accounting for complexity or sustainability.,Development Team, Scrum Master,10
5,Insufficient Backlog Refinement,Lack of regular grooming leads to incomplete understanding of stories, forcing on-the-fly decisions and cognitive strain.,Development Team, Product Owner,8
6,Daily Scrum as Status Reporting,When Daily Scrums become status meetings instead of synchronization, they waste time and add perceived pressure.,Development Team, Scrum Master,6
7,Role Ambiguity,Confusion between Product Owner, Scrum Master, and team responsibilities causes overwork or conflict.,Product Owner, Scrum Master, Team,7
8,Overlapping Sprints or Releases,Running multiple sprints in parallel (e.g., in scaled Agile) or frequent release demands reduce recovery time.,Development Team, DevOps Team,7
9,Constant Context Switching,Frequent interruptions (e.g., production bugs, unplanned tasks) break deep work and increase mental fatigue.,Development Team,8
10,Poor Definition of Done (DoD),Unclear or inconsistent DoD leads to rework, confusion, and last-minute stress before Sprint Review.,Development Team,7
11,Lack of Psychological Safety,Team members fear speaking up about blockers, delays, or mistakes, increasing internal stress and reducing transparency.,Entire Scrum Team,9
12,Inadequate Retrospective Follow-up,Identified improvements are not acted upon, leading to repeated stress patterns and demotivation.,Scrum Team, Scrum Master,6
13,Remote Work Challenges,Time zone differences, poor communication tools, or lack of informal interaction increase isolation and misalignment.,Entire Scrum Team,7
14,Overuse of Metrics (e.g., Velocity as KPI),Using velocity or burndown charts punitively creates gaming behavior and anxiety.,Development Team, Product Owner,8
15,Insufficient Technical Documentation,Developers must mentally reconstruct system logic, increasing cognitive load and error risk.,Development Team,6
16,High Interruption Rate (Slack/Email/Meetings),Too many real-time communications fragment attention and reduce productive coding time.,Development Team,7
17,Unresolved Technical Debt,Accumulated poor code quality forces developers to work around flaws, increasing effort and frustration.,Development Team,8
18,Stakeholder Pressure & High Visibility,Senior stakeholders frequently attending ceremonies or demanding updates increase performance anxiety.,Product Owner, Development Team,8
19,Inconsistent Sprint Reviews & Feedback,Receiving contradictory or delayed feedback from stakeholders leads to rework and uncertainty.,Development Team, Product Owner,7
20,Lack of Autonomy,Team has little control over how work is done, leading to disengagement and learned helplessness.,Development Team, Scrum Master,9
