Requirement Extraction,NLP Task,Uses NLP techniques (e.g., named entity recognition, sentence segmentation) to identify functional and non-functional requirements from unstructured text (e.g., meeting notes, emails, user feedback).,Product Backlog, Product Owner
Text Preprocessing,NLP Technique,Cleans and normalizes requirement texts (lowercasing, tokenization, stopword removal) to prepare for analysis.,User Stories, Backlog Refinement
Named Entity Recognition (NER),NLP Technique,Identifies key entities such as system components, actors, data types, and actions in requirement descriptions.,User Stories, Product Backlog
Intent Classification,NLP Task,Classifies user inputs or feedback into requirement types (e.g., login, payment, notification) to automate backlog item categorization.,Product Backlog, Product Owner
Sentiment Analysis,NLP Task,Analyzes stakeholder feedback or user reviews to detect satisfaction levels, helping prioritize backlog items.,Product Backlog, Sprint Review
Dependency Parsing,NLP Technique,Analyzes grammatical structure to detect relationships between requirements (e.g., "X depends on Y"), aiding in task sequencing.,Backlog Refinement, Sprint Planning
Complexity Estimation,Modeling Task,Uses ML/NLP models to predict story point complexity based on textual features (length, vocabulary, syntax, similarity to past stories).,Sprint Planning, Development Team
Automated Tagging,NLP Application,Applies labels (e.g., security, performance, UI) to user stories using keyword matching or topic modeling.,Backlog Refinement, Product Owner
Summarization,NLP Task,Generates concise summaries of long requirement documents or meeting transcripts for faster backlog review.,Product Backlog, Scrum Team
Ambiguity Detection,NLP Quality Check,Flags vague terms (e.g., "fast", "user-friendly") using lexicons or rules to improve clarity and testability of user stories.,User Stories, Backlog Refinement
Semantic Similarity,Comparison Task,Measures similarity between new and existing user stories to avoid duplication and support reuse.,Backlog Refinement, Product Owner
Topic Modeling (e.g., LDA),Clustering Technique,Groups related requirements into themes or epics based on latent topics in text.,Product Backlog, Product Owner
Acceptance Criteria Generation,NLP Generation,Uses templates or sequence models (e.g., BART, T5) to suggest acceptance criteria from user story titles.,User Stories, Development Team
Effort Prediction,ML/NLP Integration,Predicts development effort (time, story points) using historical data and textual features of requirements.,Sprint Planning, Scrum Team
Stakeholder Feedback Analysis,NLP Pipeline,Processes customer interviews, surveys, or support tickets to extract new feature requests or bugs.,Product Backlog, Product Owner
Change Impact Analysis,NLP + Graph Analysis,Identifies which requirements or components are affected by a change in a user story using dependency networks.,Backlog Refinement, Development Team
Natural Language to Code Mapping,Advanced NLP,Translates high-level requirements into pseudocode or test cases using large language models (LLMs).,Development, Testing
Backlog Prioritization Support,NLP + Decision Model,Combines NLP-extracted business value, risk, and effort to recommend prioritization rankings.,Product Backlog, Product Owner
Traceability Link Recovery,NLP Task,Automatically links user stories to test cases, code, or regulatory requirements using text similarity.,Testing, Release Planning
Chatbot-Assisted Backlog Management,Applied NLP,Enables voice/text-based interaction with backlog tools (e.g., “Add a story for login via Google”), improving accessibility.,Product Owner, Scrum Team
