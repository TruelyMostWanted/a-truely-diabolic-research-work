\section{Indices}
The following indices are used to iterate over the sets defined above.
\begin{itemize}
    \item $p$: index for a project from the set $P$
    \item $t$: index for a team from the set $T$

    \item $rep$: index for a Release Plan from the set $REP$
\end{itemize}

\section{Goals (Objective Function)}
The primary objective is to solve a multi-objective optimization problem. The function $Z$ is a weighted sum of all individual goals.
$$ \max Z = \sum_{i \in \text{Goals}_{\max}} W_i \cdot G_i - \sum_{j \in \text{Goals}_{\min}} W_j \cdot G_j $$
Where $W_k$ is the weight for goal $G_k$. The individual goals are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[G0] \textbf{maximize\_project\_budget}: Maximize the total allocated budget. Let $b_p$ be the budget for project $p$.
    $$ \max \sum_{p \in P} b_p $$
    \item[G1] \textbf{maximize\_feature\_priority}: Maximize the value from implementing high-priority features. Let $x_{f,rep}$ be a binary variable to include feature $f$ in release $rep$, and $P_f$ be its priority.
    $$ \max \sum_{f \in F} \sum_{rep \in REP} P_f \cdot x_{f,rep} $$
    \item[G2] \textbf{minimize\_task\_effort}: Minimize the total effort spent on tasks. Let $e_{tsk}$ be the effort for task $tsk$.
    $$ \min \sum_{tsk \in TSK} e_{tsk} $$
    \item[G3] \textbf{maximize\_story\_points\_per\_sprint}: Maximize story points in a sprint. Let $y_{us,sp}$ be a binary variable to include user story $us$ in sprint $sp$, and $SP_{us}$ be its story points.
    $$ \max \sum_{sp \in SP} \sum_{us \in US} SP_{us} \cdot y_{us,sp} $$
    \item[G5] \textbf{minimize\_blocker\_severity}: Minimize the impact of blockers. Let $z_{bl}$ be a binary variable for resolving blocker $bl$, and $S_{bl}$ be its severity.
    $$ \min \sum_{bl \in BL} S_{bl} \cdot (1 - z_{bl}) $$
    \item[G9] \textbf{maximize\_worker\_availability}: Maximize the use of available workforce. Let $A_w$ be the availability of worker $w$.
    $$ \max \sum_{w \in W} A_w $$
\end{itemize}

\section{Conditions (Constraints)}
The optimization is subject to the following constraints, which ensure the validity of the solution within the SCRUM framework.
\begin{itemize}
    \item[C0] \textbf{team\_size\_limit}: The size of any team $t$ must be between 3 and 9 members. Let $a_{wt}$ be the assignment of worker $w$ to team $t$.
    $$ \forall t \in T: \quad 3 \le \sum_{w \in W} a_{wt} \le 9 $$
    \item[C1] \textbf{project\_budget\_limit}: The budget $b_p$ for any project $p$ cannot exceed a predefined maximum $B_{\max}$.
    $$ \forall p \in P: \quad b_p \le B_{\max} $$
    \item[C3] \textbf{feature\_priority\_threshold}: A feature $f$ can only be included in a release plan if its priority $P_f$ is above a threshold (e.g., 3).
    $$ \forall f \in F, \forall rep \in REP: \quad x_{f,rep} \cdot (P_f - 3) \ge 0 $$
    \item[C5] \textbf{task\_effort\_cap}: The effort $e_{tsk}$ for any single task cannot exceed a cap (e.g., 16 hours).
    $$ \forall tsk \in TSK: \quad e_{tsk} \le 16 $$
    \item[C8] \textbf{product\_owner\_must\_be\_assigned}: Each project must have exactly one product owner. Let $c_{po,p}$ be the assignment of PO $po$ to project $p$.
    $$ \forall p \in P: \quad \sum_{po \in PO} c_{po,p} = 1 $$
    \item[C9] \textbf{user\_story\_must\_have\_points}: A user story $us$ can only be assigned to a sprint $sp$ if its story points $SP_{us}$ are greater than 0.
    $$ \forall us \in US, \forall sp \in SP: \quad y_{us,sp} \cdot SP_{us} > 0 $$
    \item[] \textbf{Structural Constraint (Worker Assignment)}: A worker can be assigned to at most one team.
    $$ \forall w \in W: \quad \sum_{t \in T} a_{wt} \le 1 $$
    \item[] \textbf{Structural Constraint (Task to Worker)}: The total effort of tasks assigned to a worker $w$ in a sprint $sp$ cannot exceed their capacity (Availability $\times$ Sprint Duration).
    $$ \forall w \in W, \forall sp \in SP: \quad \sum_{tsk \in TSK} e_{tsk} \cdot d_{tsk,w} \le A_w \cdot D_{sp} $$
\end{itemize}

\section{Decision Variables}
These are the variables that the optimization model will determine.
\begin{itemize}
    \item[DV0] $a_{wt} \in \{0, 1\}$: Binary variable, 1 if Worker $w$ is assigned to Team $t$, 0 otherwise.
    \item[DV1] $k_{tp} \in \{0, 1\}$: Binary variable, 1 if Team $t$ is assigned to Project $p$, 0 otherwise.
    \item[DV2] $y_{us,sp} \in \{0, 1\}$: Binary variable, 1 if User Story $us$ is selected for Sprint $sp$, 0 otherwise.
    \item[DV3] $d_{tsk,w} \in \{0, 1\}$: Binary variable, 1 if Task $tsk$ is assigned to Worker $w$, 0 otherwise.
    \item[DV5] $P_f \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$: Integer variable for the priority of Feature $f$.
    \item[DV6] $b_p \in \mathbb{R}^+$: Continuous variable for the budget of Project $p$.
    \item[DV10] $x_{f,rep} \in \{0, 1\}$: Binary variable, 1 if Feature $f$ is included in Release Plan $rep$, 0 otherwise.
    \item[DV11] $z_{bl} \in \{0, 1\}$: Binary variable, 1 if Blocker $bl$ is set to be resolved, 0 otherwise.
\end{itemize}
