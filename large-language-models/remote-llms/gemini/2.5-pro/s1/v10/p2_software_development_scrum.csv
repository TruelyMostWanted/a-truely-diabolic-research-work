ID,Step,Description,Interval,Result
1,"Project Vision Definition","The high-level goal and purpose of the product are established. Key stakeholders define what success looks like.","Once, at project inception","A clear Project Vision Statement and business case."
2,"Product Roadmap Creation","A strategic, high-level plan that outlines the likely sequence of major features or product capabilities over time.","Once, at project inception (updated periodically)","A visual Product Roadmap."
3,"Initial Product Backlog Creation","The Product Owner, with input from stakeholders, creates a comprehensive, ordered list of everything that might be needed in the product.","Once, before the first Sprint","A prioritized Product Backlog."
4,"Backlog Refinement (Grooming)","The team regularly reviews the Product Backlog to add detail, estimates, and order to the items. This is not a formal event but an ongoing activity.","Ongoing (often 1-2 hours per week)","A refined, estimated, and well-understood Product Backlog for future Sprints."
5,"Sprint Planning","The entire Scrum team collaborates to define a Sprint Goal and select items from the Product Backlog to work on during the upcoming Sprint.","Once per Sprint (at the beginning)","A Sprint Goal and a Sprint Backlog."
6,"The Sprint","A fixed-length timebox (typically 1-4 weeks) during which the Development Team works to create a 'Done', usable, and potentially releasable product Increment.","The core development cycle","Progress towards a 'Done' Increment."
7,"Daily Scrum (Stand-up)","A short, 15-minute daily meeting for the Development Team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours.","Daily, during the Sprint","Team alignment, transparency, and identification of impediments."
8,"Continuous Integration (CI)","A development practice where developers merge their code changes into a central repository frequently, after which automated builds and tests are run.","Continuously, during the Sprint","A consistently stable and integrated main codebase."
9,"Sprint Review","The Scrum Team and stakeholders inspect the Increment from the Sprint. The Development Team demonstrates the work that it has 'Done'.","Once per Sprint (at the end)","Feedback from stakeholders, which may lead to an updated Product Backlog."
10,"Sprint Retrospective","An internal team meeting to reflect on the past Sprint, discussing what went well, what could be improved, and how to make changes for the next Sprint.","Once per Sprint (after Review, before next Planning)","A list of actionable process improvements for the team."
11,"Increment","The sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the value of the increments of all previous Sprints. It must be in a usable condition.","At the end of every Sprint","A 'Done', usable, and potentially shippable product Increment."
12,"Release Planning","A decision-making process for determining when to release one or more 'Done' Increments to the end-users. This is a business decision, not a mandatory part of every Sprint.","As needed, per release cycle","A scheduled release date and plan."
13,"Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD)","An automated process that takes the 'Done' Increment, runs it through further testing in a production-like environment, and deploys it to production.","Continuously, triggered by successful CI","A rapid, reliable, and automated release of the software to users."
14,"Product Release","The act of making the new version of the software available to customers.","On decision, following successful CD pipeline","Live software in the hands of users."
15,"Feedback Loop","Gathering feedback, analytics, and insights from users interacting with the live product to inform future development.","Ongoing, post-release","New ideas, bug reports, and feature requests to be added to the Product Backlog."
