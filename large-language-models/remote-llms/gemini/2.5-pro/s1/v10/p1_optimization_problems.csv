10,"Linear Programming","LP","Optimizing a linear objective function subject to linear equality and inequality constraints. Variables are continuous.","Solvable in polynomial time. The Simplex method is efficient in practice.","The Diet Problem, Resource Allocation",10
9,"Mixed-Integer Linear Programming","MILP / MIP","An LP where some or all of the decision variables are restricted to be integers.","NP-hard in general. Solved using methods like Branch and Bound and Cutting Planes.","Facility Location Problem, Knapsack Problem",9
8,"Combinatorial Optimization","CO","Finding an optimal object from a finite, discrete set of objects. Often involves graphs, permutations, and subsets.","Contains many NP-hard problems. Solved with specialized algorithms, heuristics, or MILP formulations.","Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)",8
7,"Nonlinear Programming","NLP","The objective function or some of the constraints are nonlinear. A very broad category of problems.","Highly varied. Local optima are not guaranteed to be global optima unless the problem is convex.","Engineering Design, Chemical Process Optimization",7
6,"Convex Optimization","-","A subfield of NLP where a convex function is minimized over a convex feasible set. Any local optimum is a global optimum.","Efficiently solvable using methods like interior-point. LP and some QPs are special cases.","Support Vector Machines (SVM), Geometric Programming",6
5,"Dynamic Programming","DP","A solution methodology for problems with optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems.","Can provide polynomial-time solutions for specific problem structures that might otherwise seem exponential.","Shortest Path Problems, Sequence Alignment",5
4,"Quadratic Programming","QP","Optimizing a quadratic objective function subject to linear constraints.","Solvable in polynomial time if the objective function is convex; otherwise, it is NP-hard.","Markowitz Portfolio Optimization, Support Vector Machines (SVM)",4
3,"Stochastic Programming","SP","Optimization where some parameters are uncertain and represented by probability distributions.","Computationally intensive. Often involves solving large deterministic equivalent problems or using sampling-based methods.","Newsvendor Problem, Capacity Planning Under Uncertainty",3
2,"Constraint Programming","CP","A paradigm for solving combinatorial problems by stating constraints over variables, focusing on feasibility and search.","NP-hard in general. Very effective for highly constrained problems like scheduling and timetabling.","Employee Rostering, Sudoku",2
1,"Multi-Objective Optimization","MOP","Involves more than one objective function to be optimized simultaneously, resulting in a set of optimal trade-offs (Pareto front).","No single optimal solution. Solved using methods like weighted sum, epsilon-constraint, or evolutionary algorithms.","Product Design Trade-offs (e.g., Cost vs. Performance)",1
