1,"Sprint Goal Pressure","The intense psychological pressure to deliver the entire Sprint commitment within a short, fixed timebox. A perceived failure to meet the goal can create a strong sense of letting the team or stakeholders down.","Development Team, Product Owner, Scrum Master",10
2,"Velocity Fixation","When velocity, a capacity planning metric, is misused by management or stakeholders as a productivity target. This creates constant pressure to increase story points, often sacrificing quality and sustainable pace.","Development Team, Scrum Master, Product Owner",9
3,"Backlog Ambiguity","Starting a Sprint with poorly refined, vague, or incomplete user stories. This forces the team to constantly seek clarification, make assumptions, and perform rework, leading to high levels of uncertainty and frustration.","Development Team, Product Owner",9
4,"Team Dynamic Friction","Interpersonal conflicts, a lack of psychological safety, or poor communication within the team. The highly collaborative and transparent nature of Scrum can amplify these issues, making daily interactions stressful.","Scrum Team (all members)",9
5,"Mid-Sprint Scope Creep","Pressure from stakeholders or even the Product Owner to inject new, unplanned work into an active Sprint. This disrupts the team's focus, invalidates their plan, and creates a feeling of being powerless.","Development Team, Scrum Master, Product Owner",8
6,"Accumulating Technical Debt","The constant pressure to deliver new features leads to neglecting code quality, refactoring, and maintenance. This makes the codebase progressively harder and more stressful to work with, increasing bugs and slowing future development.","Development Team",8
7,"Production Support Overhead","Frequent and urgent interruptions from bugs or issues in the production environment. This forces developers to switch context away from Sprint work, which is cognitively demanding and jeopardizes the Sprint Goal.","Development Team",7
8,"Knowledge Silos and Bottlenecks","An over-reliance on a single team member for a specific part of the system. This places immense pressure on the 'expert' and can block or stress other team members who are unable to proceed or contribute effectively.","Development Team",7
9,"Ineffective Scrum Events","Scrum events (Planning, Daily Scrum, Review, Retrospective) that are poorly facilitated, run too long, or lack clear purpose. They become a source of cognitive drain and are perceived as wasted time rather than valuable activities.","Scrum Team (all members)",6
10,"Estimation Anxiety","The stress related to estimating work, especially during Planning Poker. Developers may feel judged on their estimates, pressured to provide lower numbers, or anxious about the uncertainty of the task ahead.","Development Team",5
