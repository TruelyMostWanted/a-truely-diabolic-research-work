10,"Linear Programming",LP,"Optimizing a linear objective function subject to linear equality and inequality constraints. All decision variables are continuous real numbers.","Efficiently solvable in polynomial time using algorithms like Simplex or Interior-Point methods.","Resource allocation, diet problem, network flow problems.",10
9,"Mixed-Integer Linear Programming",MILP or MIP,"An extension of LP where some or all decision variables are restricted to be integers. This allows for modeling discrete choices (e.g., yes/no decisions).","NP-hard, meaning worst-case solution time can grow exponentially with problem size. Solved with branch-and-bound or cutting-plane algorithms.","Facility location, production planning with on/off states, unit commitment.",9
8,"Nonlinear Programming",NLP,"An optimization problem where the objective function, some constraints, or both, contain nonlinear terms.","Can be very difficult to solve globally. Algorithms often find a local optimum, which is not guaranteed to be the best overall solution.","Training neural networks, chemical process optimization, structural design.",8
7,"Convex Optimization",-,"A special class of NLP where the objective function to be minimized is a convex function and the feasible set is a convex set.","Efficiently solvable. A key property is that any local optimum is also a global optimum, which makes them very reliable to solve.","Support Vector Machines (SVM), many forms of statistical regression (like Lasso), geometric problems.",7
6,"Quadratic Programming",QP,"Optimizing a quadratic objective function subject to linear constraints. It is a specific type of NLP.","If the objective function is convex, it is efficiently solvable. Non-convex QPs are much harder (NP-hard).","Markowitz portfolio optimization (balancing risk and return), control systems.",6
5,"Combinatorial Optimization",-,"Finding an optimal object from a finite set of objects. It deals with problems where the set of feasible solutions is discrete.","Many problems are NP-hard. Often tackled with specialized algorithms, heuristics, or by formulating as a MILP.","Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), knapsack problem, graph coloring.",5
4,"Dynamic Programming",DP,"An algorithmic technique for solving problems by breaking them down into simpler, overlapping subproblems and solving each subproblem only once.","Very efficient for problems that exhibit optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems.","Shortest path problems (Bellman-Ford), inventory control, sequence alignment.",4
3,"Stochastic Programming",SP,"A framework for modeling optimization problems that involve uncertainty. Some parameters are represented as random variables rather than deterministic values.","Computationally intensive. Often solved by considering a set of discrete scenarios for the uncertain parameters.","Supply chain management with uncertain demand, financial planning with market volatility.",3
2,"Multi-Objective Optimization",MOO,"Involves optimizing more than one objective function simultaneously. The objectives often conflict with each other.","Does not yield a single optimal solution but a set of trade-off solutions known as the Pareto front.","Engineering design (e.g., minimize weight AND maximize strength), finance (maximize return AND minimize risk).",2
1,"Constraint Programming",CP,"A paradigm for solving problems by stating constraints over variables. It focuses more on finding a feasible solution than optimizing an objective.","Very effective for highly combinatorial problems like scheduling and puzzles. Relies on techniques like constraint propagation and backtracking search.","Employee timetabling/rostering, Sudoku, detailed scheduling tasks.",1
