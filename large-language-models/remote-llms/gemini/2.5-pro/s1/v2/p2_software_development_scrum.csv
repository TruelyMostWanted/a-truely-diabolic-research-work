ID,Step,Description,"Interval",Result
1,"Product Vision Definition","Defining the overarching goal and purpose of the product. This sets the long-term direction and answers 'Why are we building this?'.","Once per project or major pivot","A clear, shared understanding of the product's objective."
2,"Product Roadmap Creation","Outlining the major features, themes, and expected timeline for the product's evolution. It provides a high-level strategic view.","Initially, then updated quarterly or as needed","A strategic guide for stakeholders and the development team."
3,"Initial Product Backlog Creation","The Product Owner, with input from stakeholders, creates an initial list of all desired features, requirements, and fixes, ordered by priority.","Once at the project's start","An ordered list of work to be done (Product Backlog)."
4,"Sprint Planning","The Scrum Team collaborates to define a Sprint Goal and select items from the Product Backlog to work on during the upcoming Sprint.","Start of each Sprint (typically 1-4 weeks)","Sprint Goal and Sprint Backlog."
5,"Daily Scrum","A 15-minute daily meeting for the Developers to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary.","Daily, during the Sprint","Increased transparency, identification of impediments, and an adjusted plan for the next 24 hours."
6,"Development Work","The core activity where Developers work on Sprint Backlog items to create a 'Done' increment. Includes all tasks like designing, coding, and testing.","Throughout the Sprint","Completed backlog items that meet the Definition of Done."
7,"Product Backlog Refinement","The ongoing process of adding detail, estimates, and order to items in the Product Backlog. This ensures the backlog is ready for future sprints.","Ongoing activity, typically 1-2 times per Sprint","A well-defined and prioritized Product Backlog."
8,"Code Commit & Peer Review","A Developer commits code changes to a shared version control repository. Other team members review the code for quality and correctness.","Continuously, multiple times per day","Improved code quality and shared knowledge across the team."
9,"Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline","An automated process of building the software and running automated tests (e.g., unit, integration) after each code commit.","On every code commit to the main branch","A validated and integrated codebase; early detection of integration errors."
10,"Sprint Review","The Scrum Team presents the work completed during the Sprint to key stakeholders. Feedback is gathered to inform the next steps.","End of each Sprint","A demonstrated Product Increment and stakeholder feedback for future backlog adaptation."
11,"Sprint Retrospective","The Scrum Team inspects its own performance regarding individuals, interactions, processes, and tools, and creates a plan for improvements.","End of each Sprint, after the Sprint Review","A concrete, actionable plan for improving team effectiveness in the next Sprint."
12,"Product Increment Release","The act of deploying the potentially shippable increment from one or more Sprints to the production environment for users.","At the Product Owner's discretion; can be after every sprint or more frequently.","New, valuable functionality delivered to end-users."
13,"Continuous Deployment (CD) Pipeline","An automated pipeline that takes the successfully built and tested code from CI and deploys it through various environments (e.g., staging) and into production.","Triggered by successful CI builds and tests, often with a manual approval gate for production.","A fast, reliable, and repeatable deployment process."
14,"Production Monitoring & Feedback","Observing the live application's performance, stability, and usage. Gathering user feedback, bug reports, and analytics from the production environment.","Continuously, post-release","Actionable insights, new bug reports, and feature ideas that feed back into the Product Backlog."
