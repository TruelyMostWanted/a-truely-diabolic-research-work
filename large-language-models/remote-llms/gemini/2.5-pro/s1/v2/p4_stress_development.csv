ID,Name,Description,AffectedEntities,Influence
1,"Lack of Psychological Safety","An environment where team members don't feel safe to voice concerns, admit mistakes, challenge ideas, or ask for help without fear of blame or retribution. This is a foundational stressor that amplifies all others.","Entire Scrum Team",10
2,"Sprint Commitment Pressure","The Sprint Backlog is often misinterpreted as a rigid contract. The perceived or real pressure to deliver every single item 'committed' to in Sprint Planning, regardless of emergent issues, creates a constant crunch.","Developers, Product Owner",9
3,"Technical Debt Accumulation","Continuous pressure to deliver features quickly leads to compromises in code quality. This 'debt' makes future development exponentially harder, slower, and more stressful as the codebase degrades.","Developers, Product Backlog, Definition of Done",9
4,"Unrefined Backlog & Scope Creep","Starting a Sprint with poorly understood requirements or having scope added mid-sprint creates ambiguity, rework, and frustration. The cognitive load of constantly re-evaluating unplanned work is significant.","Developers, Product Owner, Sprint Backlog",8
5,"Velocity as a Performance Target","When velocity, a capacity planning metric, is used by management to measure productivity or push for 'more points', it creates perverse incentives to cut corners, inflate estimates, and leads to burnout.","Developers, Scrum Master, Management",8
6,"Context Switching & Interruptions","Developers being pulled away from their Sprint tasks to handle urgent bugs, support tickets, or other 'important' requests. This shatters focus and dramatically reduces efficiency, leading to frustration.","Developers, Scrum Master",7
7,"Stakeholder Pressure","During Sprint Reviews or other interactions, stakeholders may express disappointment, demand more features, or question the team's pace. This pressure is often funneled through the Product Owner but can leak to the team.","Product Owner, Developers",7
8,"Unrealistic Definition of Done (DoD)","A DoD that is either gold-plated and unachievable within a Sprint, or too vague, leading to constant debates about whether work is truly complete. This creates friction and uncertainty, especially near the end of a Sprint.","Developers, Product Owner, Definition of Done",6
9,"Estimation Anxiety","The process of estimating work can become stressful if teams are challenged to provide lower estimates, or if their estimates are later used to judge their performance. This can lead to hedging or defensive behavior.","Developers, Product Owner",6
10,"Daily Scrum as a Status Report","When the Daily Scrum devolves from a team-sync and planning event into a status report for managers or the Scrum Master, team members feel performance anxiety and a pressure to always report 'good' progress.","Developers",5
11,"Interpersonal Conflict","Unresolved disagreements or poor communication styles within a highly collaborative team. The constant interaction required by Scrum can make these conflicts a chronic source of stress.","Entire Scrum Team",5
12,"Role Ambiguity or Overload","When the accountabilities of the Scrum roles are not respected. For example, a Product Owner forced to act as a project manager, or a Scrum Master with no authority to remove organizational impediments.","Product Owner, Scrum Master",4
