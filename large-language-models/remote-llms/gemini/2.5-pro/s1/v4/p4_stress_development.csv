ID,Name,Description,"AffectedEntities","Influence"
1,Overcommitment and Unrealistic Forecasts,"The team feels pressured to pull more work into a Sprint than they can realistically complete. This leads to rushing, cutting corners, and a sense of failure at the end of the Sprint.","Development Team, Scrum Master",10
2,External Pressure and Unrealistic Deadlines,"Stakeholders or management impose external deadlines that override the team's capacity-based planning. This undermines the team's autonomy and creates intense pressure to deliver at any cost.","Whole Scrum Team, Product Owner",10
3,High Technical Debt,"The cumulative effect of poor technical decisions makes new development slow, unpredictable, and frustrating. Every task becomes a struggle against a brittle codebase.","Development Team",9
4,Ambiguous or Volatile Requirements,"Product Backlog Items are poorly defined or their acceptance criteria change frequently. This forces the team to guess, leading to rework, wasted effort, and frustration.","Development Team, Product Owner",9
5,Mid-Sprint Scope Creep,"New, unplanned work is pushed into an active Sprint. This disrupts the team's focus, invalidates their initial plan, and adds pressure to an already full workload.","Development Team, Scrum Master",8
6,Misuse of Metrics (e.g., Velocity),"Management uses metrics like velocity not as a planning tool, but as a performance target to pressure the team to 'go faster', leading to burnout and poor quality.","Whole Scrum Team",8
7. Excessive Context Switching,"Team members are frequently pulled off their Sprint tasks to handle production support, urgent bugs, or other projects. This constant interruption fragments focus and kills productivity.","Development Team",8
8,External Dependencies and Blockers,"The team's progress is frequently halted by reliance on other teams, services, or decisions outside of their control, creating a feeling of powerlessness as the Sprint clock ticks.","Development Team, Scrum Master",7
9,The Sprint Timebox Pressure,"The fixed, short-cycle deadline of the Sprint creates a recurring pressure peak. While designed to focus work, it can feel like a relentless hamster wheel if there's no slack.","Development Team",6
10,Lack of Psychological Safety,"Team members are afraid to admit mistakes, ask for help, or disagree with seniors/stakeholders. This stifles collaboration and makes retrospectives and daily scrums stressful.","Whole Scrum Team",6
11,Pressure for 'Accurate' Estimation,"Story point estimation is treated as a binding contract rather than a forecast. The team is pressured to provide precise estimates for highly uncertain work, leading to anxiety.","Development Team",5
12,Ineffective Scrum Events,"Poorly facilitated events, such as a Daily Scrum that turns into a status report for managers or endless refinement meetings, waste time and add to the cognitive load.","Whole Scrum Team",4
