10,Linear Programming,LP,"A technique to achieve the best outcome in a mathematical model whose requirements are represented by linear relationships. It involves a linear objective function and linear constraints.",Efficiently solvable in polynomial time (e.g., via Simplex or Interior-Point methods).,"The Diet Problem: finding the cheapest combination of foods that satisfies all the daily nutritional requirements.",10
9,Mixed-Integer Linear Programming,MILP or MIP,"An extension of LP where some or all of the decision variables are restricted to be integer values. This allows for modeling discrete choices (e.g., yes/no decisions).",NP-hard. Solvability in practice depends heavily on the problem structure; can be very difficult for large instances.,Facility Location: deciding where to build warehouses to minimize total shipping costs.,9
8,Nonlinear Programming,NLP,"A broad class of problems where either the objective function or one or more of the constraints are nonlinear functions of the decision variables.",Varies greatly. Non-convex NLPs are very hard to solve globally and algorithms may only find a local optimum.,Optimal Power Flow: determining the most efficient power generation levels in an electrical grid.,8
7,Quadratic Programming,QP,"A type of NLP where the objective function is a quadratic function of the decision variables and the constraints are linear.",Efficiently solvable if the objective function is convex; otherwise it is NP-hard.,Markowitz Portfolio Optimization: finding the asset allocation that minimizes risk (variance) for a given level of expected return.,7
6,Convex Optimization,"CO","A subfield of optimization that studies the problem of minimizing convex functions over convex sets. This structure guarantees that any local optimum is also a global optimum.",Generally considered efficiently solvable. Includes LP and convex QP as special cases.,Support Vector Machine (SVM): finding the optimal hyperplane to separate data points in machine learning.,6
5,Combinatorial Optimization,---,"Problems focused on finding an optimal object from a finite set of objects. The problem space is discrete and often involves graphs; structures; and permutations.",Most non-trivial problems are NP-hard. Often solved using MIP formulations or specialized algorithms.,"The Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP): finding the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city.",5
4,Stochastic Programming,SP,"A framework for modeling optimization problems that involve uncertainty. Some of the parameters (e.g.; customer demand; prices) are unknown and are modeled as random variables.",Computationally very intensive. Often much harder to solve than their deterministic counterparts.,Inventory Management under Uncertainty: deciding how much stock to hold when future demand is not known for certain.,4
3,Dynamic Programming,DP,"An algorithmic technique for solving complex problems by breaking them down into a collection of simpler; overlapping subproblems. It is suited for problems with optimal substructure.",Efficient if the state space is manageable. Can suffer from the ""curse of dimensionality"" where the state space grows exponentially.,Shortest Path Problems: finding the path with the minimum cost between two nodes in a graph (e.g.; Bellman-Ford algorithm).,3
2,Constraint Programming,CP,"A paradigm for solving combinatorial problems by stating constraints over a set of variables with specific domains. The solver systematically finds a feasible solution by propagating constraints.",Effective for highly constrained problems like scheduling and timetabling where finding a feasible solution is the main challenge.,Exam Timetabling: assigning university exams to time slots such that no student has a conflict.,2
1,Heuristics and Metaheuristics,---,"A category of solution methods used for problems that are too complex or large to be solved optimally. These methods aim to find a good; feasible solution in a reasonable amount of time without guaranteeing optimality.",Provides approximate solutions quickly. The quality of the solution is not guaranteed.,Genetic Algorithms for Vehicle Routing: finding good-enough routes for a fleet of delivery vehicles in a very large city.,1
