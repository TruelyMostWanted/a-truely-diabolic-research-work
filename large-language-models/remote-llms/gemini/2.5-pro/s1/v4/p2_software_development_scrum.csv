ID,Step,Description,"Interval","Result"
1,Product Vision Definition,"The key stakeholders define the high-level goal of the product. This answers the questions of what the product is, who it is for, and why it is needed.","Once per project/major initiative","A clear, concise Product Vision Statement."
2,Team Formation & Setup,"A cross-functional, self-organizing Development Team is assembled, along with a dedicated Product Owner and Scrum Master. Development environments and CI/CD pipelines are configured.","Once at the project's start","A fully formed Scrum Team and a ready technical infrastructure."
3,Initial Product Backlog Creation,"The Product Owner, collaborating with stakeholders, creates an initial list of all known features, requirements, and user stories. This list is ordered by priority and value.","Once at the start, then continuously refined","A prioritized and ordered Product Backlog."
4,Sprint Planning,"The Scrum Team collaborates to select a set of high-priority Product Backlog Items (PBIs) to work on for the upcoming Sprint and defines a Sprint Goal.","Start of each Sprint (e.g., every 1-4 weeks)","A Sprint Goal and a Sprint Backlog (the list of PBIs to be completed)."
5,Development Work (The Sprint),"The Development Team works on the items in the Sprint Backlog, turning them into a demonstrable increment of the product. This includes design, coding, testing, and integration.","Daily, throughout the Sprint","Completed and tested Product Backlog Items."
6,Daily Scrum,"A 15-minute, time-boxed meeting for the Development Team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours. They inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal.","Daily","A coordinated team with a transparent plan for the day."
7,Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD),"As developers commit code, an automated pipeline builds, tests, and integrates the changes. This provides rapid feedback on code quality and integration issues.","Continuously, upon code commits","An always-running, tested, and integrated codebase."
8,Product Backlog Refinement,"An ongoing activity where the Product Owner and the Development Team review and revise items on the Product Backlog, adding detail, estimates, and order to upcoming items.","Ongoing during the Sprint","A healthy and well-prepared Product Backlog for future Sprints."
9,Sprint Review,"At the end of the Sprint, the Scrum Team demonstrates the work they accomplished to stakeholders. This is a session to elicit feedback and discuss progress.","End of each Sprint","Stakeholder feedback, and an updated Product Backlog based on new insights."
10,Sprint Retrospective,"The Scrum Team inspects itself and creates a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint. This focuses on process, tools, and team collaboration.","End of each Sprint","A set of actionable improvement items for the team to implement."
11,Increment,"The sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the value of the increments of all previous Sprints. At the end of a Sprint, the new Increment must be ""Done"" and in a useable condition.","End of each Sprint","A Potentially Shippable Increment (PSI) of the product."
12,Release Decision & Deployment,"The Product Owner decides when to release the functionality to customers. This can happen at the end of any Sprint, and is decoupled from the Sprint cycle itself. The CI/CD pipeline is used to deploy the release.","As needed, when sufficient value is built up","The product increment is delivered to the end-users."
13,Monitoring & Feedback Collection,"After a release, the team monitors the product's performance, stability, and usage in the production environment. They actively collect user feedback, bug reports, and analytics.","Continuously post-release","Actionable data, including bug reports, feature requests, and performance metrics."
14,Backlog Update from Feedback,"The collected feedback and data from the live product are used to create new Product Backlog Items or to re-prioritize existing ones, thus closing the feedback loop.","Continuously","A dynamic Product Backlog that reflects real-world user needs and issues."
