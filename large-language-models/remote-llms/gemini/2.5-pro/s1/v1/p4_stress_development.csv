1,"Commitment vs. Forecast Pressure","When a Sprint forecast is treated as a non-negotiable commitment or promise, the team feels immense pressure to deliver everything, leading to overwork and fear of failure.","Development Team, Product Owner, Scrum Master",10
2,"Lack of Psychological Safety","An environment where team members don't feel safe to voice concerns, admit mistakes, challenge ideas, or be vulnerable without fear of blame or ridicule, leading to high interpersonal stress.","Scrum Team, Stakeholders",10
3,"High Technical Debt","The constant need to work around poorly written code, bugs, and architectural flaws increases the cognitive load for every task and slows down development, causing deep-seated frustration.","Development Team",9
4,"Sprint Timebox Pressure","The fixed, short duration of a Sprint creates a recurring deadline. If not managed well, this can feel like a constant race against the clock rather than a sustainable cadence.","Development Team, Scrum Master",9
5,"Unrealistic Stakeholder Expectations","External or internal stakeholders demanding features on unrealistic timelines or with a poor understanding of the team's capacity, putting constant pressure on the Product Owner and the team.","Product Owner, Scrum Team",8
6,"Mid-Sprint Scope Creep","Introducing new work or changing the scope of existing items after a Sprint has started. This disrupts the team's focus, invalidates their plan, and adds unplanned cognitive load.","Development Team, Product Owner",8
7,"Unclear Requirements","Starting a Sprint with poorly defined, ambiguous, or incomplete Product Backlog Items forces developers into constant clarification cycles, leading to rework and decision fatigue.","Development Team, Product Owner",8
8,"Frequent Context Switching","Team members being frequently interrupted or pulled onto tasks outside the Sprint Goal (e.g., urgent production support, ad-hoc requests), which breaks deep focus and reduces productivity.","Development Team",7

10,"Perceived Skill Gaps / Impostor Syndrome","Individual team members feeling they lack the necessary skills for their tasks, leading to personal anxiety, reluctance to take on challenges, and a fear of letting the team down.","Development Team",6
11,"Inefficient Tooling and Environment","Constant struggles with slow computers, unreliable build pipelines, or cumbersome development environments add daily friction and frustration, wasting cognitive energy that could be spent on problem-solving.","Development Team",5
12,"Velocity as a Performance Metric","When story points or velocity are used by management as a tool to measure and compare team or individual performance, it creates perverse incentives and pressure to inflate estimates.","Scrum Team, Scrum Master",5
