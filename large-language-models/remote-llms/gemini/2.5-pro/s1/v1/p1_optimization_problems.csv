1,"Linear Programming","LP","An optimization problem where the objective function and all constraints are linear functions of the decision variables.","Efficiently solvable in polynomial time using methods like the Simplex or Interior-Point algorithms.","Resource allocation, transportation logistics, diet problem.",10
2,"Mixed-Integer Linear Programming","MILP / ILP","An LP where some (MILP) or all (ILP) decision variables are restricted to be integer values. Models discrete choices.","NP-hard, but modern solvers are highly effective for many practical problems using techniques like Branch and Bound.","Facility location, vehicle routing, production scheduling.",9
3,"Nonlinear Programming","NLP","An optimization problem where the objective function or at least one of the constraints is a nonlinear function.","Highly varied. Convex NLPs are generally tractable. Non-convex NLPs are hard to solve globally; algorithms often find local optima.","Training neural networks, portfolio optimization with variance, chemical process optimization.",8
4,"Quadratic Programming","QP","A type of NLP where the objective function is a quadratic function and the constraints are linear.","Tractable if the objective function is convex (a local minimum is a global minimum). Non-convex QPs are NP-hard.","Support Vector Machines (SVM), Markowitz portfolio model, optimal control.",7
5,"Convex Optimization","CO","A broad class where a convex function is minimized over a convex feasible set. A key property is that any local optimum is a global optimum.","Very efficiently solvable. Includes LP, convex QP, and others like Second-Order Cone Programming (SOCP) and Semidefinite Programming (SDP).","Least squares regression, maximum likelihood estimation, geometric design.",6
6,"Dynamic Programming","DP","An algorithmic paradigm for solving complex problems by breaking them into a collection of simpler, overlapping subproblems and solving each subproblem only once.","Efficient for problems with optimal substructure. Can suffer from the 'curse of dimensionality' as the state space grows.","Shortest path problems, inventory management, sequence alignment.",5
7,"Stochastic Programming","SP","Optimization under uncertainty, where some parameters are unknown and represented by probability distributions. Aims to optimize an expected value.","Computationally intensive, often requiring the solution of very large-scale deterministic equivalent problems or using sampling methods.","Supply chain planning with uncertain demand, energy generation scheduling.",4
8,"Combinatorial Optimization","","Deals with finding an optimal object from a finite set of objects. Often involves graphs, permutations, or discrete structures.","Many canonical problems are NP-hard. Problems with special structure (e.g., minimum spanning tree) are solvable in polynomial time.","Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), graph coloring, knapsack problem.",3
9,"Robust Optimization","RO","An approach for optimization under uncertainty where the uncertain parameters are assumed to lie within a deterministic 'uncertainty set'. Seeks a solution that is feasible for all possible parameter values.","Often leads to tractable reformulations that are larger but maintain the class of the original problem (e.g., a robust LP is still an LP).","Robust portfolio design, control systems, project management with uncertain durations.",2
10,"Global Optimization","GO","The task of finding the globally best solution of a non-convex problem, in the possible presence of multiple local optima.","Extremely challenging. Requires specialized global solvers or heuristic/metaheuristic methods (e.g., simulated annealing, genetic algorithms).","Drug discovery (molecular docking), protein folding, integrated circuit layout.",1
