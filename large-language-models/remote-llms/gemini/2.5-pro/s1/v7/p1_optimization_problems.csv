1,"Linear Programming","LP","An optimization problem where the objective function and all constraints are linear functions of the continuous decision variables.","Considered 'solved'. Highly efficient algorithms (like Simplex) exist that can solve problems with millions of variables and constraints to global optimality.","Resource allocation, production planning, diet problem.",10
2,"Mixed-Integer Linear Programming","MILP / MIP","A Linear Programming problem where some or all of the decision variables are restricted to be integer values. This allows for modeling logical constraints and discrete choices.","NP-hard, but modern commercial and open-source solvers are extremely powerful. They use branch-and-bound and cutting-plane algorithms to solve many large-scale, real-world problems.","Facility location, vehicle routing, production scheduling.",9
3,"Nonlinear Programming","NLP","An optimization problem where the objective function or at least one of the constraints is a nonlinear function of the decision variables.","Highly dependent on the problem structure. If it's a convex problem, a global optimum can be found efficiently. For non-convex problems, solvers may only guarantee a locally optimal solution.","Training neural networks, portfolio optimization with risk, engineering design.",8
4,"Quadratic Programming","QP","A special type of NLP where the objective function is quadratic and all constraints are linear.","If the quadratic objective function is convex, the problem is efficiently solvable. Non-convex QPs are much harder (NP-hard).","Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Markowitz portfolio optimization, optimal control.",7
5,"Convex Optimization","-","A broad class of problems (including LP and convex QP) where the objective is a convex function and the feasible region is a convex set. A key property is that any local optimum is also a global optimum.","Considered a tractable class of problems. Specialized and efficient algorithms (like interior-point methods) can reliably find the global optimum.","Least squares regression, logistic regression, geometric programming.",6
6,"Integer Programming","IP","A special case of MILP where all decision variables must be integers. Binary (0-1) IP is a very common subclass used for yes/no decisions.","NP-hard. The same methods used for MILP apply here. The lack of continuous variables can sometimes make them harder to solve than a MILP of similar size.","Knapsack problem, set covering, assignment problem.",5
7,"Multi-Objective Optimization","MOO","Problems that involve optimizing more than one, often conflicting, objective function simultaneously. The goal is to find a set of trade-off solutions (Pareto front).","There is no single optimal solution. The output is a set of Pareto optimal solutions. Methods include weighted sum, epsilon-constraint, and evolutionary algorithms.","Product design (e.g., minimize cost, maximize strength), investment (e.g., maximize return, minimize risk).",4
8,"Stochastic Programming","SP","An optimization framework for problems where some of the data (e.g., customer demand, market prices) is uncertain and is modeled using probability distributions.","Computationally very challenging. Often results in very large-scale deterministic equivalent problems or requires sampling-based solution methods (e.g., SAA).","Supply chain management under demand uncertainty, energy planning with uncertain resource availability.",3
9,"Robust Optimization","RO","An approach to optimization under uncertainty where parameters are assumed to lie within a given 'uncertainty set'. The goal is to find a solution that is feasible for all possible parameter values.","Tractability depends heavily on the structure of the problem and the uncertainty set. Can often be reformulated as a tractable, though larger, deterministic problem. More conservative than SP.","Bridge design under uncertain loads, project management with uncertain task durations.",2
10,"Dynamic Programming","DP","A solution method for problems that can be broken down into sequential or recursive subproblems. It solves problems with optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems.","A powerful technique, but its applicability is limited by the state space size (the 'curse of dimensionality'). It's more of a solution methodology than a problem class.","Shortest path problems, inventory control, resource allocation over time.",1
