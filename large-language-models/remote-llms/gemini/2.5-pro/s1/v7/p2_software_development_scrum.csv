ID,Step,Description,"Interval",Result
1,"Product Vision & Goal Definition","The key stakeholders and Product Owner establish the overall vision, goals, target audience, and value proposition for the product.","Once at the project's inception.","A clear Product Goal and vision statement that guides all future development."
2,"Initial Product Backlog Creation","The Product Owner, with input from stakeholders and the team, creates a preliminary, ordered list of all features, requirements, enhancements, and fixes.","Once at the start, then continuously refined.","A prioritized Product Backlog with enough items for the first few sprints."
3,"Sprint 0 / Team Setup (Optional)","An optional, preparatory phase for setting up infrastructure, development environments, team formation, and high-level architectural design before the first official sprint.","Once before the first sprint.","A ready team and environment to begin development work efficiently."
4,"Sprint Planning","The entire Scrum Team collaborates to define a Sprint Goal (the 'why') and selects Product Backlog Items (the 'what'). The Developers then create a plan for how to build the Increment.","Once per Sprint (at the beginning)","A Sprint Goal and a Sprint Backlog (the plan for the Sprint)."
5,"The Sprint","A time-boxed period (typically 1-4 weeks) during which the Developers work to create a 'Done', usable, and potentially releasable product Increment.","The duration of the Sprint (e.g., 2 weeks)","A valuable and functional product Increment that meets the Sprint Goal."
5.1,"Development Work & Code Commit","Developers take items from the Sprint Backlog, write code, create tests, and perform other tasks needed to complete them.","Daily, throughout the Sprint.","Completed code and tests for a specific task or feature."
5.2,"Continuous Integration (CI)","Upon code commit, an automated system builds the software and runs a suite of tests (unit, integration) to verify the changes and detect issues early.","Continuously, on every code commit.","A validated build and test report; rapid feedback on code quality."
5.3,"Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)","If CI is successful, the build is automatically deployed to a staging environment for further testing. In Continuous Deployment, it can be automatically released to production.","Continuously, after a successful CI build.","A new version of the software available in a staging or production environment."
6,"Daily Scrum","A short (15-minute) daily meeting for the Developers to inspect progress towards the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary.","Daily, during the Sprint.","A synchronized team with a clear plan for the next 24 hours; impediments are identified."
7,"Product Backlog Refinement","An ongoing activity where the Product Owner and the Developers collaborate to add details, estimates, and order to items in the Product Backlog.","Ongoing (1-2 times per Sprint)","A well-understood and 'ready' backlog for upcoming Sprints."
8,"Sprint Review","The Scrum Team presents the result of their work (the Increment) to key stakeholders. The goal is to gather feedback and adapt future plans.","Once per Sprint (at the end)","Actionable feedback from stakeholders and a potentially revised Product Backlog."
9,"Sprint Retrospective","The Scrum Team meets to reflect on the past Sprint, inspecting how well their processes, tools, and collaboration worked, and identifying improvements.","Once per Sprint (after the Sprint Review)","At least one concrete, actionable improvement for the next Sprint."
10,"Increment Release to Production","The act of making the potentially shippable Increment from one or more Sprints available to end-users. This can happen at any time during or after a Sprint.","As needed, based on business value.","Value is delivered to the customer; the product is live."
11,"Post-Release Monitoring & Feedback","After a release, the team monitors the application's performance, stability, and user behavior. Feedback is collected through analytics, support channels, and user interviews.","Continuously, after each release.","Data, bug reports, and new feature ideas that feed back into the Product Backlog."
