1,"Sprint Timebox Pressure","The relentless, fixed-length deadline of the sprint creates a constant sense of urgency and a recurring 'end-of-sprint crunch' to complete all forecasted work.","Developers, Scrum Master",10
2,"Commitment Misinterpretation","The Sprint Backlog 'forecast' is treated as a contractual promise. This creates immense pressure to deliver every item, punishing discovery and discouraging realistic adaptation.","Developers, Product Owner, Scrum Master",9
3,"Velocity as a Performance Target","When management uses velocity as a productivity metric, creating a push for ever-increasing output. This leads to burnout, corner-cutting, and low morale.","Entire Scrum Team, Stakeholders",9
4,"Backlog Ambiguity & Unreadiness","Starting a sprint with vague, large, or poorly understood items from the Product Backlog. This causes mid-sprint uncertainty, rework, and stress from unclear expectations.","Developers, Product Owner",8
5,"Cognitive Load from Technical Debt","The constant mental effort required to work around fragile, complex, or poorly-designed code. It slows progress, increases the risk of bugs, and is mentally exhausting.","Developers",8
6,"External Stakeholder Pressure","Unrealistic demands, attempts to add or change work mid-sprint, and impatience from stakeholders who may not understand or respect the Scrum process.","Product Owner, Developers",8
7,"Lack of Psychological Safety","A team environment where members fear blame, conflict, or admitting mistakes. This stifles honest communication in Daily Scrums and Retrospectives, creating interpersonal tension.","Entire Scrum Team",7
8,"Ineffective Retrospectives","When retrospectives fail to address core issues or when identified improvements are never acted upon. This leads to a sense of helplessness and recurring frustration.","Entire Scrum Team",7

10,"Context Switching & Interruptions","Frequent interruptions from outside the sprint's scope or pressure to work on multiple unrelated tasks at once, which fragments focus and drains cognitive energy.","Developers",6
11,"'Status Report' Daily Scrum","When the Daily Scrum devolves from a team-synchronization event into a status report for a manager or PO, creating performance anxiety and reducing its value.","Developers",5
12,"Role Conflict (PO vs. Developers)","Tension between the Product Owner's drive to maximize feature delivery and the Developers' need to maintain code quality and address technical debt.","Product Owner, Developers",5
