10,"Linear Programming","LP","An optimization problem where the objective function and all constraints are linear functions of the decision variables. Variables are continuous.","Efficiently solvable to a global optimum in polynomial time (e.g., using Interior-Point methods) or via the Simplex algorithm.","The Diet Problem (finding the cheapest combination of foods to meet nutritional requirements), Resource Allocation.",10
9,"Mixed-Integer Linear Programming","MILP / MIP","A type of LP where some, but not all, decision variables are restricted to be integers. This allows for modeling logical choices (e.g., yes/no decisions).","NP-hard in general. Solved using methods like Branch and Bound. Practical solvability depends heavily on problem size and structure.","Facility Location, Supply Chain Network Design, Unit Commitment in power generation.",9
8,"Nonlinear Programming","NLP","An optimization problem where the objective function or at least one of the constraints is a nonlinear function of the decision variables.","Can be very difficult. If convex, a global optimum can be found efficiently. If non-convex, solvers may only find a local optimum. Finding the global optimum is generally NP-hard.","Training a deep neural network, Shape optimization in engineering.",8
7,"Quadratic Programming","QP","A type of NLP where the objective function is a quadratic function and the constraints are linear.","If the objective function is convex, the problem is efficiently solvable. If non-convex, it is much harder (NP-hard).","Markowitz portfolio optimization in finance, Support Vector Machines (SVM) in machine learning.",7
6,"Convex Optimization","CO","A broad class of problems (including LP and convex QP) where the objective is a convex function and the feasible set is a convex set. A key property is that any local minimum is also a global minimum.","Efficiently solvable to a global optimum. This class has well-developed theory and powerful solvers.","LASSO regression, Geometric programming, many machine learning problems.",6
5,"Combinatorial Optimization","","A field concerned with finding an optimal object from a finite set of objects. Problems are typically discrete and often involve graphs.","Many prominent problems are NP-hard, requiring heuristics, approximation algorithms, or integer programming formulations to solve for large instances.","Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP).",5
4,"Integer Linear Programming","ILP / IP","A type of LP where all decision variables are restricted to be integers. A special case of MILP.","NP-hard in general. It is at least as hard as MILP.","The Knapsack Problem, Set Covering Problem, Sudoku.",4
3,"Stochastic Programming","SP","Optimization problems that involve uncertainty, where some of the parameters are represented by probability distributions.","Computationally very intensive. Often solved by formulating large-scale deterministic equivalents or using sampling-based methods.","Financial planning under uncertain market conditions, optimal operation of a dam with uncertain rainfall.",3
2,"Dynamic Programming","DP","A method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into a collection of simpler, nested subproblems. It's used for sequential decision-making over time.","Solvability depends on the state space and problem structure. Can suffer from the 'curse of dimensionality' where the state space grows exponentially.","Shortest path problems in a graph (Bellman-Ford algorithm), Inventory Control.",2
1,"Robust Optimization","RO","A branch of optimization that deals with uncertainty by optimizing for the worst-case scenario within a given uncertainty set. It provides solutions that are feasible for any realization of the uncertainty.","Often results in a computationally tractable problem (e.g., LP, SOCP), but can be more conservative than stochastic programming.","Designing a bridge to withstand the worst-case load, robust portfolio management.",1
