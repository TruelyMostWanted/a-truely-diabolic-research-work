ID,Name,Description,AffectedEntities,Influence
1,"Sprint Timebox Pressure","The constant, non-negotiable deadline at the end of each sprint to deliver a 'Done' increment. This can lead to rushing work, cutting corners on quality, or anxiety as the end date approaches.","Development Team, Sprint Goal, Definition of Done",10
2,"Overcommitment in Sprint Planning","The team feels pressured (by themselves or others) to pull more work into the Sprint Backlog than they can realistically complete. This sets the team up for a feeling of failure from the start.","Sprint Planning, Development Team, Sprint Backlog, Sprint Goal",9
3,"Ambiguous or Changing Requirements","User stories or Product Backlog Items lack clarity or acceptance criteria, leading to guesswork and rework. Scope creep within a sprint forces constant mental re-planning and invalidates prior work.","Product Owner, Development Team, PBI, Sprint Backlog",9
4,"High Technical Debt","The accumulated 'cruft' from past shortcuts or suboptimal design choices makes every new task more difficult and time-consuming than it should be, creating constant friction and frustration.","Development Team, Definition of Done, Product Increment",8
5,"Unresolved Impediments","Team members are blocked on tasks but impediments (e.g., waiting for an external dependency, environment issues) are not removed quickly. This creates a sense of helplessness and stalls progress.","Scrum Master, Development Team, Daily Scrum",8
6,"Poor Team Dynamics","A lack of psychological safety, interpersonal conflicts, a blame culture, or low trust within the team. This makes collaboration, a cornerstone of Scrum, stressful and inefficient.","Development Team, Sprint Retrospective, Daily Scrum",8
7,"External Stakeholder Pressure","Pressure from management or customers who may not fully understand the Scrum process, leading to demands for fixed deadlines, unrealistic scope, or frequent interruptions.","Product Owner, Scrum Master, The entire Scrum Team",7
8,"Frequent Context Switching","Developers are pulled off their planned sprint tasks to handle 'urgent' bugs, support requests, or other interruptions, breaking their focus and increasing cognitive load.","Development Team, Sprint Goal, Sprint Backlog",7
9,"Knowledge Silos / Skill Gaps","A single team member is the only one who can work on a critical part of the system. This creates a bottleneck and puts immense pressure on that individual, while blocking others.","Development Team, Sprint Planning",6
10,"Performance Metrics Anxiety","An excessive focus on metrics like velocity or story points as a measure of productivity rather than a planning tool. This can lead to teams gaming the numbers or feeling constant pressure to increase velocity.","Development Team, Scrum Master, Product Owner",6
11,"Ineffective Scrum Events","Meetings like the Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, or Retrospective are poorly facilitated, run too long, or devolve into status reporting or blaming sessions, making them a source of dread rather than value.","The entire Scrum Team, All Scrum Events",5
12,"Task Complexity Uncertainty","A task selected in Sprint Planning turns out to be far more complex than initially estimated. This can jeopardize the Sprint Goal and create stress as developers struggle with unforeseen challenges.","Development Team, PBI, Sprint Planning",5
