ID,Step,Description,Interval,Result
1,"Project Vision & Goal Setting","High-level definition of the project's purpose, scope, and goals. Establishes the 'why' behind the product.","Once at the project's inception. Reviewed periodically (e.g., quarterly).","A clear Product Vision Statement and a set of business goals.
2,"Initial Product Backlog Creation","The Product Owner, with input from stakeholders, creates an initial list of all desired features, functionalities, requirements, and fixes.","Once at the start of the project, before the first sprint.","A prioritized list of Product Backlog Items (PBIs), often as user stories.
3,"Roadmap Planning","Creating a high-level, strategic plan that outlines the likely sequence of major feature releases over time.","Typically done quarterly or biannually.","A visual product roadmap for stakeholders.
4,"Sprint 0 / Preparation","Optional phase for initial setup tasks like team formation, setting up the development environment, architectural spikes, and refining the top of the backlog.","Once, before the first official development sprint.","A ready team, a configured environment, and a well-prepared backlog for Sprint 1.
5,"Sprint Planning","The Scrum team collaboratively plans the work to be performed in the upcoming sprint. They select PBIs and define a Sprint Goal.","At the beginning of every Sprint (e.g., every 2 weeks).","A Sprint Goal and a Sprint Backlog (the set of PBIs chosen for the sprint).
6,"Daily Scrum","A short, daily meeting for the Development Team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours. Often structured as What I did yesterday, what I'll do today, any impediments.","Daily, at the same time and place.","Team alignment, identification of impediments, and an adjusted plan for the day's work.
7,"Development & Implementation","The core development work of the sprint. This includes designing, coding, unit testing, and integrating the features defined in the Sprint Backlog.","Continuously throughout the Sprint.","Completed and tested software components according to the Sprint Backlog.
8,"Product Backlog Refinement","The ongoing process of adding detail, estimates, and order to items in the Product Backlog. This is not a formal event but a crucial activity.","Ongoing; often 1-2 short meetings per sprint.","A well-defined and 'ready' backlog for future sprints.
9,"Continuous Integration (CI)","An automated process where developers merge their code changes into a central repository frequently, after which automated builds and tests are run.","Continuously, triggered on every code commit.","A constantly validated and integrated main codebase, early detection of integration errors.
10,"Sprint Review","A meeting at the end of the sprint where the Scrum Team and stakeholders inspect the work 'Done' and collaborate on the next things that could be done.","At the end of every Sprint.","Feedback from stakeholders, a potentially shippable product increment, and an updated Product Backlog.
11,"Sprint Retrospective","A meeting for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next sprint.","At the end of every Sprint, after the Sprint Review.","A list of actionable process improvements for the team to implement.
12,"Release Planning","The process of deciding when to release the accumulated value to the customers. A release can happen at the end of any sprint.","As needed, when a valuable increment is ready. Can be after one or many sprints.","A go/no-go decision for a release and a communication plan.
13,"Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)","The practice of automating the release of validated code to a testing or production environment. Continuous Deployment releases every validated change to users automatically.","Continuously, after CI successfully completes.","A rapid and reliable release process, enabling frequent delivery of value to users.
14,"Deployment to Production","The final step of making the software increment available to end-users.","On-demand, as per the release plan.","The new version of the software is live.
15,"Monitoring & Feedback Collection","Using tools to monitor the application's performance, stability, and usage in the production environment. Gathering user feedback through various channels.","Continuously, post-release.","Performance metrics, error logs, user satisfaction data, and new ideas for the Product Backlog.
