1,"Sprint Overcommitment / Unrealistic Forecast","The team is pressured or feels obliged to pull more work into a Sprint than they can realistically complete. This creates constant time pressure and a feeling of failure when the forecast is not met.","Development Team, Scrum Master",10
2,"Velocity Weaponization","When velocity, a planning metric, is used by management as a performance target to demand ever-increasing output. This creates a culture of cutting corners and fear.","Development Team, Scrum Master, Product Owner",10
3,"Lack of Psychological Safety","Team members do not feel safe to voice concerns, admit mistakes, or challenge ideas without fear of blame or retribution. This stifles collaboration and makes retrospectives ineffective.","Development Team, Scrum Master, Product Owner",9
4,"High Technical Debt","The constant need to work around poorly written code or architectural flaws slows down development, makes estimates unreliable, and causes deep frustration for developers.","Development Team",9
5,"External Stakeholder Pressure","Stakeholders bypass the Product Owner to make direct demands on the Development Team, or they apply intense pressure during Sprint Reviews, creating a stressful 'us vs. them' dynamic.","Development Team, Product Owner, Scrum Master",8
6,"Backlog Volatility & Lack of a Clear Goal","The Sprint Goal is ill-defined, or priorities within the Sprint Backlog change frequently mid-sprint. This leads to wasted work, context switching, and a sense of purposelessness.","Development Team, Product Owner",8
7,"Frequent Context Switching","Developers are constantly interrupted by non-sprint related 'urgent' tasks, meetings, or support issues, which breaks their focus and dramatically increases cognitive load.","Development Team",8
8,"Production Emergencies / Firefighting","Unexpected critical bugs in production that require immediate attention, derailing the Sprint and causing high-pressure, reactive work. Becomes severe when it is a regular occurrence.","Development Team",8
9,"PO Unavailability or Indecisiveness","The Product Owner is not available to answer questions or provides conflicting or delayed decisions, leaving the team blocked and unable to proceed with clarity.","Development Team, Product Owner",7
10,"Ineffective Impediment Removal","The Scrum Master or organization is unable to resolve blockers reported by the team, leaving developers frustrated and feeling unsupported in their work.","Development Team, Scrum Master",7
11,"Unrealistic 'Definition of Done' (DoD)","The criteria for completing a story are so extensive or 'gold-plated' that it becomes extremely difficult to get any work to a 'Done' state within a single sprint, leading to carry-over and frustration.","Development Team",6
12,"Estimation Pressure","The team feels immense pressure to provide a 'perfect' or low estimate during Sprint Planning, with the fear of being blamed if the work takes longer than the initial guess.","Development Team",6
13,"Internal Team Conflict","Disagreements, skill gaps, or poor communication within the Development Team that are not addressed, leading to a breakdown in collaboration and a stressful work environment.","Development Team",6
14,"Daily Scrutiny (Misused Daily Scrum)","The Daily Scrum is used as a status report for managers rather than a planning session for the team, causing members to feel micromanaged and anxious about reporting progress.","Development Team",5
