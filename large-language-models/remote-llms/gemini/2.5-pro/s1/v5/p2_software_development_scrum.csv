ID,Step,Description,Interval,Result
1,"Project Inception & Vision","Defining the high-level goals, scope, and overall vision for the product. Creating an initial product roadmap outlining major features and expected timelines.","Once per project/major version","Product Vision Statement, High-Level Product Roadmap"
2,"Initial Product Backlog Creation","The Product Owner (PO) creates a prioritized list of all known features, requirements, user stories, and fixes needed for the product.","Once at the project start, then refined continuously","An ordered list of Product Backlog Items (PBIs)"
3,"Sprint Planning","The Scrum Team collaboratively selects high-priority items from the Product Backlog to work on, defines a tangible Sprint Goal, and creates a plan (Sprint Backlog) to achieve it.","Once per Sprint (at the beginning)","A Sprint Goal and a Sprint Backlog"
4,"Sprint Execution","The Development Team works on the items in the Sprint Backlog. This phase includes all design, development, integration, and testing needed to create a 'Done' piece of software.","The duration of a Sprint (typically 1-4 weeks)","A 'Done', usable, and potentially releasable product Increment"
5,"Daily Scrum","A short, 15-minute daily meeting for the Development Team to synchronize, inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal, and adapt the plan for the next 24 hours.","Daily, during the Sprint","Transparency on progress, identification of impediments, and a daily work plan"
6,"Product Backlog Refinement","An ongoing activity where the PO and the Development Team add details, estimates, and order to items in the Product Backlog, preparing them for future Sprints.","Ongoing (often 1-2 times per Sprint)","A refined and well-understood Product Backlog"
7,"Sprint Review","At the end of the Sprint, the Scrum Team and stakeholders review what was accomplished. The Development Team demonstrates the 'Done' work to gather feedback.","Once per Sprint (at the end)","Stakeholder feedback, an adapted Product Backlog, and validation of the completed work"
8,"Sprint Retrospective","The Scrum Team inspects its own performance and processes regarding people, relationships, process, and tools. They create a plan for improvements to be enacted in the next Sprint.","Once per Sprint (after the Sprint Review)","Actionable process improvement items for the team"
9,"Continuous Integration (CI)","An automated process where developers merge code changes into a central repository frequently, triggering an automated build and test sequence.","Continuously / Multiple times per day","A verified and integrated codebase, early detection of bugs"
10,"Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)","An automated extension of CI where code changes that pass all tests are automatically prepared for a release to a production environment (Delivery) or automatically released (Deployment).","Continuously, following successful CI","A reliably deployable build, enabling rapid and frequent releases"
11,"Product Release","The act of making a new version of the software, containing one or more Sprints' worth of Increments, available to the end-users. This is a business decision.","On-demand (can be after any Sprint)","New features and value delivered to the customer"
12,"Monitoring & Feedback Loop","Post-release, the product is monitored for performance, stability, and user engagement. User feedback, analytics, and bug reports are collected.","Continuously post-release","Data-driven insights, bug reports, and new feature ideas that are fed back into the Product Backlog"
