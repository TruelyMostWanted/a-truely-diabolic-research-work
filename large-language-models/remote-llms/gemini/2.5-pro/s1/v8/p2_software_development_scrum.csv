ID,Step,Description,Interval,Result
1,"Project Vision & Goal Setting","The Product Owner, stakeholders, and team align on the high-level purpose, goals, and vision for the product or project.","Once per project (revisited as needed)","A clear Product Vision Statement and business objectives."
2,"Initial Product Backlog Creation","The Product Owner creates an initial, ordered list of all desired features, functions, requirements, enhancements, and fixes for the product.","Once per project","An initial, prioritized Product Backlog."
3,"Definition of Done (DoD) Establishment","The development team agrees on and documents the criteria that a Product Backlog Item must meet before it can be considered 'done' and part of an increment.","Once per project (revisited as needed)","A clear and shared Definition of Done."
4,"Sprint Planning","The Scrum Team collaborates to plan the work for the upcoming Sprint. It answers 'What' can be delivered and 'How' the work will be done.","Once per Sprint","A Sprint Goal and a Sprint Backlog containing the selected Product Backlog Items."
5,"Sprint Execution / Development","The development team works on the items in the Sprint Backlog to turn them into a 'Done' increment of the product. This is the main development phase.","Throughout the Sprint","Completed and tested features according to the Sprint Backlog."
6,"Daily Scrum (Stand-up)","A short, daily 15-minute meeting for the development team to synchronize activities, inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal, and create a plan for the next 24 hours.","Daily","Team synchronization, identification of impediments, and a daily plan."
7,"Product Backlog Refinement (Grooming)","An ongoing activity where the Product Owner and the Development Team add detail, estimates, and order to items in the Product Backlog.","Ongoing (typically 5-10% of Sprint time)","A well-defined and prioritized Product Backlog ready for future Sprints."
8,"Sprint Review","At the end of the Sprint, the Scrum Team and stakeholders inspect the Increment. The team presents what was accomplished and gets feedback.","Once per Sprint","Feedback from stakeholders and an updated Product Backlog reflecting new insights."
9,"Sprint Retrospective","The Scrum Team inspects itself and creates a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint. It focuses on the process, tools, and relationships.","Once per Sprint","A list of actionable process improvements for the next Sprint."
10,"Increment","The sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the value of the increments of all previous Sprints. At the end of a Sprint, the new Increment must be 'Done'.","End of every Sprint","A potentially shippable, valuable piece of working software."
11,"Release Planning","The Product Owner decides whether to release the latest increment. This is a business decision based on whether the increment provides sufficient value.","As needed (can be every Sprint or after several Sprints)","A decision to either release the current increment or continue development."
12,"Continuous Integration (CI)","An automated process where developers merge their code changes into a central repository frequently, after which automated builds and tests are run.","Continuously (on every code commit)","A validated build and automated test results, ensuring the main codebase is always stable."
13,"Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)","An automated process that takes the successfully integrated code from CI and deploys it to a testing or production environment.","Continuously (triggered by successful CI)","A new version of the software deployed and available to users."
14,"Monitoring & Feedback Collection","After a release, the team monitors the software's performance, stability, and usage in production. Feedback is actively collected from users.","Ongoing post-release","Performance metrics, bug reports, and user feedback."
15,"Backlog Update from Feedback","The Product Owner processes the collected feedback, creating new Product Backlog Items (e.g., bug fixes, new features) to address user needs and issues.","Continuously","A refined and updated Product Backlog that reflects real-world user feedback."
