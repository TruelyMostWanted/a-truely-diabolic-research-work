1,"Linear Programming",LP,"Optimizing a linear objective function subject to linear equality and inequality constraints. It's the foundation of many other optimization types.",Computationally efficient. Can be solved in polynomial time (P) using methods like the Simplex or interior-point algorithms.,"The Diet Problem: finding the cheapest combination of foods to meet nutritional requirements.",10
2,"Mixed-Integer Linear Programming",MILP / MIP,"An extension of LP where some or all decision variables are restricted to be integer values. Incredibly versatile for real-world decisions.",NP-hard. Can be very difficult to solve for large instances, often requiring branch-and-bound or cutting-plane methods.,"Facility Location Problem: deciding where to build warehouses to minimize total shipping distance, with a binary decision for each potential location.",9
3,"Nonlinear Programming",NLP,"An optimization problem where the objective function, some of the constraints, or both, contain nonlinear parts. A very broad and diverse category.",Generally difficult. Solvability heavily depends on the problem's structure (e.g., convexity). Local optima may not be global optima.,"Portfolio Optimization (Markowitz model): maximizing a portfolio's return for a given level of risk (variance), which is a nonlinear objective.",8
4,"Quadratic Programming",QP,"A type of NLP where the objective function is quadratic and the constraints are linear. A common and well-structured problem.",More complex than LP, but solvable efficiently if the objective function is convex.,"Support Vector Machines (SVM) in machine learning, which find an optimal separating hyperplane by solving a QP problem.",7
5,"Convex Optimization",-,"A broad class of problems (includes LP and some QP) where the objective is a convex function to be minimized over a convex feasible set. A key property is that any local optimum is also a global optimum.",Highly solvable. A wide range of efficient algorithms exist, making it a very desirable problem structure.,"Least-Squares Regression in statistics, which minimizes the sum of squared errors.",6
6,"Combinatorial Optimization",-,"Finding an optimal object from a finite, or countably infinite, set of objects. Often involves graphs and discrete structures. Overlaps heavily with integer programming.",Typically NP-hard. Often requires heuristics, metaheuristics (like simulated annealing, genetic algorithms), or approximation algorithms for large-scale problems.,"Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP): finding the shortest possible route that visits a set of cities and returns to the origin.",5
7,"Stochastic Programming",SP,"Deals with optimization under uncertainty, where some parameters of the model are not known for certain but are represented by probability distributions.",Computationally very demanding. Often requires specialized decomposition methods and significant computing power.,"Supply Chain Management: deciding on inventory levels in the face of uncertain future customer demand.",4
8,"Dynamic Programming",DP,"An algorithmic technique for solving complex problems by breaking them down into a collection of simpler, overlapping subproblems and solving each subproblem only once.",Solvability depends on the state space and structure of the problem. Can be very efficient if applicable.,"Shortest Path Problems (like Dijkstra's or Bellman-Ford algorithms), finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.",3
9,"Multi-Objective Optimization",MOP,"Involves optimizing more than one objective function simultaneously. The objectives often conflict with each other, leading to a set of optimal trade-off solutions (Pareto front).",Aims to find a set of solutions rather than a single one. Computationally intensive and requires specialized solvers.,"Engineering Design: designing a car to simultaneously maximize fuel efficiency, maximize safety, and minimize production cost.",2
10,"Constraint Programming",CP,"A paradigm for solving combinatorial problems by stating constraints on the variables and having a solver find a feasible solution. Focus is more on feasibility than on a single optimal objective.",Very effective for highly constrained problems like scheduling and timetabling, but can struggle with large, loosely constrained optimization problems.,"Employee Timetabling: creating a work schedule for a team of employees, respecting all constraints like availability, required skills, and work-hour limits.",1
