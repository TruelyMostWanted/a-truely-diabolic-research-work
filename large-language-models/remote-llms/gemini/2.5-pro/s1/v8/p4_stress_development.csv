ID,Name,Description,AffectedEntities,Influence
1,"Mid-Sprint Goal Changes","When stakeholders or the Product Owner change the Sprint Goal or introduce new high-priority work after the Sprint has started. This invalidates the plan and creates chaotic rework.",Development Team, Product Owner,10
2,"Lack of Psychological Safety","An environment where team members feel unable to voice concerns, admit mistakes, or ask for help without fear of blame or punishment. This leads to suppressed issues and high personal anxiety.",Whole Scrum Team,10
3,"High Technical Debt","The constant need to work around previous poor design choices or bugs. This slows down development, increases complexity, and causes frustration as simple tasks become difficult.",Development Team,9
4,"Velocity as a Performance Metric","When management or stakeholders use sprint velocity as a productivity target rather than a capacity planning tool. This pressures the team to inflate estimates and cut corners on quality.",Development Team, Scrum Master,9
5,"Ambiguous Requirements / User Stories","Starting a Sprint with poorly defined or vague Product Backlog Items. This forces developers to make assumptions, leading to rework and cognitive load from constant uncertainty.",Development Team, Product Owner,8
6,"Unrealistic External Deadlines","Pressure to meet a fixed release date that is not aligned with the team's established velocity and the scope of work. This often leads to cutting quality, long hours, and burnout.",Whole Scrum Team,8
7,"Scope Creep within the Sprint","Continuously adding 'small' tasks or expanding the scope of existing items during a sprint without removing other work. This undermines the sprint plan and the team's commitment.",Development Team,8
8,"Sprint Timebox Pressure","The inherent and constant pressure of the sprint deadline. While designed to create focus, it can become a major stressor if the sprint is overcommitted or plagued with interruptions.",Development Team,7
9,"Interpersonal Conflict","Unresolved disagreements or poor communication between team members, or with the Product Owner or Scrum Master. This creates a tense and unproductive work environment.",Whole Scrum Team,7
10,"High-Stakes Demos / Sprint Reviews","When the Sprint Review is treated as a pass/fail judgment of the team's performance rather than a collaborative feedback session. This creates performance anxiety and fear of failure.",Development Team,6
11,"Unreliable Tooling or Infrastructure","Frequent failures in the CI/CD pipeline, development environments, or other essential tools. This causes constant interruptions, context switching, and frustration, blocking progress on planned work.",Development Team,6
12,"Overwhelming Product Backlog","A very large, poorly organized, or constantly shifting Product Backlog can make the overall workload feel insurmountable and directionless, leading to motivational decline.",Product Owner, Development Team,5
13,"Knowledge Silos / Key-Person Dependency","Relying on a single team member for a specific area of expertise. This puts immense pressure on that individual and creates a bottleneck for the rest of the team.",Development Team,5
14,"Context Switching","Frequent interruptions from outside the sprint work, such as urgent support requests or meetings unrelated to the Sprint Goal, which break focus and reduce efficiency.",Development Team,4
