ID,Step,Description,"Interval","Result"
1,"Product Vision Definition","Establishing the overall goal, target audience, and motivation for the product.","Once per project","A clear Product Vision statement"
2,"Product Roadmap Creation","Outlining the major features and strategic goals for the product's evolution over time.","Once initially, updated periodically","A strategic Product Roadmap"
3,"Initial Product Backlog Creation","The Product Owner populates the Product Backlog with all known features, requirements, and user stories.","Once initially, then refined continuously","An initial, ordered Product Backlog"
4,"Definition of Done (DoD) Workshop","The entire Scrum Team agrees on the criteria that a Product Backlog Item must meet to be considered complete and releasable.","Once initially, updated as needed","A formal Definition of Done (DoD)"
5,"Sprint Planning","The Scrum Team selects items from the Product Backlog for the upcoming Sprint and creates a plan for how the work will be done.","Once per Sprint (at the beginning)","A Sprint Goal and a Sprint Backlog"
6,"Development Work","The ongoing work by Developers to turn Sprint Backlog items into a valuable, potentially releasable Increment.","Continuously throughout the Sprint","Progress on the Increment"
