10,"Linear Programming",LP,"Optimizing a linear objective function subject to linear equality and inequality constraints. Variables are continuous.",Efficiently solvable in polynomial time (e.g., Simplex, Interior-Point methods).,"Resource allocation, production planning, diet problem",10
9,"Mixed-Integer Linear Programming",MILP,"An extension of LP where some or all decision variables are restricted to be integers. Combines continuous and discrete variables.",NP-hard in general, but modern solvers are very effective for many practical problems.,"Facility location, supply chain design, vehicle routing",9
8,"Nonlinear Programming",NLP,"An optimization problem where the objective function or some of the constraints are nonlinear.",Solvability varies greatly. Convex NLPs are generally easier to solve for a global optimum. Non-convex NLPs are very difficult.,"Portfolio optimization with transaction costs, chemical process engineering",8
7,"Convex Optimization",-,"A broad class of problems that involves minimizing a convex function over a convex set. Includes LP and some QPs as special cases.",Highly solvable. If a local optimum is found, it is guaranteed to be the global optimum.,"Support Vector Machines (SVM), geometric problems, parameter estimation",7
6,"Quadratic Programming",QP,"Optimizing a quadratic objective function subject to linear constraints. Variables are continuous.",Efficiently solvable if the objective function is convex; otherwise, it is NP-hard.,"Markowitz portfolio optimization, optimal control",6
5,"Integer Programming",IP,"A type of optimization problem where all decision variables are restricted to be integers.",NP-hard. More general and often harder than MILP if the structure is not linear.,"Knapsack problem, scheduling, capital budgeting",5
4,"Combinatorial Optimization",-,"A field concerned with finding an optimal object from a finite set of objects. Often involves graphs and discrete structures.",Many problems are NP-hard. Requires specialized algorithms (e.g., heuristics, branch-and-bound).,"Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), graph coloring",4
3,"Dynamic Programming",DP,"A method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler, overlapping subproblems and solving each subproblem only once.",Solvability depends on the state space and problem structure. Can be very efficient if applicable.,"Shortest path problems, inventory control, sequence alignment",3
2,"Stochastic Programming",SP,"A framework for modeling optimization problems that involve uncertainty. Data is often represented by probability distributions.",Computationally very challenging, often requiring specialized decomposition methods or approximation schemes.,"Capacity planning under demand uncertainty, financial planning",2
1,"Multi-objective Optimization",MOP,"Problems involving more than one objective function to be optimized simultaneously, resulting in a set of trade-off (Pareto optimal) solutions.",Does not yield a single optimal solution but a set of them. Solvers aim to find or approximate the Pareto front.,"Product design (cost vs. quality), environmental policy (economy vs. pollution)",1
