% --- DECISION VARIABLES ---
\section{Decision Variables}
\label{sec:decisionvariables}
These are the variables that the optimization model can change to achieve the goals. Parameters (attributes of entities) are denoted with text, e.g., $\text{story\_points}_{us}$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item $X_{us, sbl} \in \{0, 1\}$: Binary variable; 1 if User Story $us$ is assigned to Sprint Backlog $sbl$, 0 otherwise.
    \item $A_{w, t} \in \{0, 1\}$: Binary variable; 1 if Worker $w$ is assigned to Team $t$, 0 otherwise.
    \item $B_{tsk, w} \in \{0, 1\}$: Binary variable; 1 if Task $tsk$ is assigned to Worker $w$, 0 otherwise.
    \item $I_{f, rep} \in \{0, 1\}$: Binary variable; 1 if Feature $f$ is included in Release Plan $rep$, 0 otherwise.
    \item $J_{w, r} \in \{0, 1\}$: Binary variable; 1 if Worker $w$ takes on Role $r$, 0 otherwise.
    \item $P_f \in \mathbb{Z}^+$: Integer variable for the priority assigned to Feature $f$.
    \item $S_{us} \in \mathbb{Z}^+$: Integer variable for the story points assigned to User Story $us$.
    \item $E_{tsk} \in \mathbb{R}^+$: Real variable for the effort assigned to Task $tsk$.
    \item $\text{Status}_{tsk} \in \{\text{todo, in\_progress, done}\}$: Categorical variable for the status of Task $tsk$.
    \item $\text{Budget}_p \in \mathbb{R}^+$: Real variable for the budget allocated to Project $p$.
    \item $\text{Severity}_{bl} \in \mathbb{Z}^+$: Integer variable for the severity assigned to Blocker $bl$.
\end{itemize}

% --- GOALS (OBJECTIVE FUNCTION) ---
\section{Goals}
\label{sec:goals}
This section describes the objectives of the model. The overall objective function is a weighted sum of these individual goals, where $W_{Gi}$ is the weight for goal $i$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{G0: maximize\_story\_points}\\
    Maximize the total story points from user stories assigned to sprint backlogs.
    $$ \text{Maximize} \quad W_{G0} \sum_{us \in US} \sum_{sbl \in SBL} S_{us} \cdot X_{us, sbl} $$
    
    \item \textbf{G2: maximize\_feature\_priority}\\
    Maximize the value from features included in release plans, based on their priority.
    $$ \text{Maximize} \quad W_{G2} \sum_{f \in F} \sum_{rep \in REP} P_f \cdot I_{f, rep} $$

    \item \textbf{G3: maximize\_team\_satisfaction}\\
    Maximize the team satisfaction recorded in sprint retrospectives.
    $$ \text{Maximize} \quad W_{G3} \sum_{sre \in SRE} \text{team\_satisfaction}_{sre} $$

    \item \textbf{G4: minimize\_blocker\_severity}\\
    Minimize the sum of severities of all blockers.
    $$ \text{Minimize} \quad W_{G4} \sum_{bl \in BL} \text{Severity}_{bl} $$
    
    \item \textbf{G7: minimize\_task\_effort}\\
    Minimize the total effort planned for all tasks.
    $$ \text{Minimize} \quad W_{G7} \sum_{tsk \in TSK} E_{tsk} $$

    \item \textbf{G10: maximize\_worker\_availability}\\
    Maximize the total availability of all workers.
    $$ \text{Maximize} \quad W_{G10} \sum_{w \in W} \text{availability}_w $$
\end{itemize}

% --- CONDITIONS (CONSTRAINTS) ---
\section{Conditions}
\label{sec:conditions}
This section lists the constraints that the solution must satisfy.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{C0: constrain\_team\_size\_upper}\\
    The size of any given team must not exceed 9 members. Let $\text{WorkersOf}(t)$ be the set of workers assigned to team $t$.
    $$ \forall t \in T: \quad \sum_{w \in W} A_{w, t} \leq 9 $$

    \item \textbf{C1: constrain\_team\_size\_lower}\\
    The size of any given team must be at least 3 members.
    $$ \forall t \in T: \quad \sum_{w \in W} A_{w, t} \geq 3 $$
    
    \item \textbf{C4: constrain\_sprint\_effort\_by\_velocity}\\
    The total story points of user stories in a sprint backlog must not exceed the associated team's velocity. Let $\text{VelocityOf}(t)$ be the velocity for team $t$.
    $$ \forall sbl \in SBL, \forall t \in T: \quad \sum_{us \in US} S_{us} \cdot X_{us, sbl} \leq \text{VelocityOf}(t) $$

    \item \textbf{C6: task\_must\_be\_done\_for\_story}\\
    If a User Story's status is 'done', all its constituent tasks must also be 'done'. Let $\text{TasksOf}(us)$ be the set of tasks for a user story.
    $$ \forall us \in US: (\text{status}_{us} = \text{'done'}) \implies (\forall tsk \in \text{TasksOf}(us), \text{Status}_{tsk} = \text{'done'}) $$
    
    \item \textbf{C7: constrain\_project\_by\_budget}\\
    The project's incurred costs must not exceed its allocated budget.
    $$ \forall p \in P: \quad \text{IncurredCost}(p) \leq \text{Budget}_p $$

    \item \textbf{C8: require\_feature\_priority}\\
    Every feature must have a priority greater than zero.
    $$ \forall f \in F: \quad P_f \geq 1 $$

    \item \textbf{C10: worker\_must\_be\_available}\\
    A task can only be assigned to a worker if their status is 'available'.
    $$ \forall tsk \in TSK, \forall w \in W: \quad B_{tsk, w} = 1 \implies \text{status}_w = \text{'available'} $$

\end{itemize}
