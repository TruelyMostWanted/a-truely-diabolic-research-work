Based on Entities.csv and Relationships.csv - Proceed and Create 3 individual CSV code-blocks (alternative: files) in chat named: Goals.csv + Conditions.csv + DecisionVariables.csv
Goals.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,IsSum,GoalType,EntityName,EntityAttribute,CriteriaType,Weight""
Conditions.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,IsSum,GoalType,EntityName,EntityAttribute,CriteriaType,Weight""
DecisionVariables.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,DataType,Domain,MinValue,MaxValue""

The following conventions must be applied:
ID starts with a letter G(oals), C(onditions), D(ecision)V(ariables) and a number follows, starting at 0, 1, 2, ....
Name is written snake_case
Names for Goals must begin with ""maximize_"" or ""minimize_""
IsSum is a boolean { True, False }
GoalType is one of { ""min"", ""max"" }
EntityName is always only 1 entry from the ""Name"" of Entities.csv
EntityAttribute is one of the values in the ""Attribute0"" to ""Attribute8"" of the targeted Entity in Entities.csv
CriteriaType is a number { 2 = Must-Match, 1 = May-Match, 0 = Cannot-Match }
Domain can represent set of values like ""{0,1}""
MinValue is the smallest value that can be set
MaxValue is the highest value that can be set
Weight is a mulptlier

Below is an example of how you can structure this data into a graph using Mermaid's `graph TD` (top-down) syntax. This example assumes some placeholder data for each category:

```mermaid

  // Connect Entities with their Relations

### Explanation:

- **Entities** are represented by `E1`, `E2` and colored in blue.
- **Attributes** such as `A1`, `A2`, `A3` are connected to the entities they belong to, shown in white.
- **Relations** like `R1`, `R2` connect between entities and are orange.
- **Goals** (`G1`, `G2`) connect to either entities or attributes and are green.
- **Conditions** (`C1`, `C2`) link with entities or attributes and are red.
- **Decision Variables** (`DV1`, `DV2`) directly relate to the relevant entities and appear in purple.

Adjust node names and connections as per your actual data. This structure provides a visual representation of how these different components interact within your system using Mermaid.js. You can paste this code into the Mermaid Live Editor to visualize it."
