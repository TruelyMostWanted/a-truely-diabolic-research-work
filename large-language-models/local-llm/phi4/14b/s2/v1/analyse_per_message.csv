Based on Entities.csv and Relationships.csv - Proceed and Create 3 individual CSV code-blocks (alternative: files) in chat named: Goals.csv + Conditions.csv + DecisionVariables.csv
Goals.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,IsSum,GoalType,EntityName,EntityAttribute,CriteriaType,Weight""
Conditions.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,IsSum,GoalType,EntityName,EntityAttribute,CriteriaType,Weight""
DecisionVariables.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,DataType,Domain,MinValue,MaxValue""

The following conventions must be applied:
ID starts with a letter G(oals), C(onditions), D(ecision)V(ariables) and a number follows, starting at 0, 1, 2, ....
Name is written snake_case
Names for Goals must begin with ""maximize_"" or ""minimize_""
IsSum is a boolean { True, False }
GoalType is one of { ""min"", ""max"" }
EntityName is always only 1 entry from the ""Name"" of Entities.csv
EntityAttribute is one of the values in the ""Attribute0"" to ""Attribute8"" of the targeted Entity in Entities.csv
CriteriaType is a number { 2 = Must-Match, 1 = May-Match, 0 = Cannot-Match }
Domain can represent set of values like ""{0,1}""
MinValue is the smallest value that can be set
MaxValue is the highest value that can be set
Weight is a mulptlier
Created 10 to 15 entries in each of these files."

### Instructions:

1. **Replace Placeholder Text**: Replace the placeholder text (e.g., ""Your Name"", example items) with actual data from your CSV files.

2. **Add Entities, Indices, Goals, Conditions, and Decision Variables**:
   - For each section, add items as shown in the examples.
   - Ensure that mathematical expressions are enclosed within `\begin{equation}` and `\end{equation}` for proper formatting.

3. **Compile with LaTeX**: Save this content into a `.tex` file and compile it using a LaTeX editor to generate the PDF document.

### Explanation:

- **Entities** are represented as nodes and colored blue.
- **Attributes** are connected to their respective Entities and colored white.
- **Relations** connect between Entities and are colored orange.
- **Goals** connect to either an Entity or Attribute and are colored green.
- **Conditions** connect to an Entity or Attribute and are colored red.
- **Decision Variables** connect to relevant Entities and are colored purple.

You can customize this template by adding more entities, attributes, relations, goals, conditions, and decision variables as per your CSV data. Simply follow the pattern shown above for each new element."
