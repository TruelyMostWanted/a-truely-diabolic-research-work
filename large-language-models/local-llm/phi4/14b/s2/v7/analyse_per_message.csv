Based on Entities.csv and Relationships.csv - Proceed and Create 3 individual CSV code-blocks (alternative: files) in chat named: Goals.csv + Conditions.csv + DecisionVariables.csv
Goals.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,IsSum,GoalType,EntityName,EntityAttribute,CriteriaType,Weight""
Conditions.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,IsSum,GoalType,EntityName,EntityAttribute,CriteriaType,Weight""
DecisionVariables.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,DataType,Domain,MinValue,MaxValue""

The following conventions must be applied:
ID starts with a letter G(oals), C(onditions), D(ecision)V(ariables) and a number follows, starting at 0, 1, 2, ....
Name is written snake_case
Names for Goals must begin with ""maximize_"" or ""minimize_""
IsSum is a boolean { True, False }
GoalType is one of { ""min"", ""max"" }
EntityName is always only 1 entry from the ""Name"" of Entities.csv
EntityAttribute is one of the values in the ""Attribute0"" to ""Attribute8"" of the targeted Entity in Entities.csv
CriteriaType is a number { 2 = Must-Match, 1 = May-Match, 0 = Cannot-Match }
Domain can represent set of values like ""{0,1}""
MinValue is the smallest value that can be set
MaxValue is the highest value that can be set
Weight is a mulptlier

### Instructions for Usage:

1. **Replace Placeholders**: Fill in the placeholders (e.g., `Your Name`, entity details, indices, goals, conditions, and decision variables) with actual content derived from your CSV files.

2. **Compile with LaTeX**: Use a LaTeX editor or command-line tool to compile this `.tex` file into a PDF document. Make sure you have all necessary packages installed (e.g., `amsmath` for mathematical formatting).

3. **Verify Content**: Ensure that the IDs, names, and logical/mathematical representations of goals and conditions match your CSV data.

By following these steps, you should be able to generate a structured optimization model document in LaTeX based on your provided data categories."

Then, we'll structure them according to the specified connections and color coding.

Here's how you can represent this in Mermaid.js Live Editor:

```mermaid
graph TD

    // Define Entities (in blue)
    subgraph Entity1[Entity1]
        style Entity1 fill:#blue,stroke-width:2px,color:white;
    end
    
    subgraph Entity2[Entity2]
        style Entity2 fill:#blue,stroke-width:2px,color:white;
    end

    // Define Attributes (in white)
    A1(Attribute1 of Entity1) --> Entity1
    A2(Attribute2 of Entity1) --> Entity1
    A3(Attribute1 of Entity2) --> Entity2
    
    // Define Relations (in orange)
    R1[Relation1] -->|Entity1 to Entity2| Entity2
    style R1 fill:#orange,stroke-width:2px,color:white;
    
    // Define Goals (in green)
    G1[Goal1] --> Entity1
    G2[Goal2] --> A3
    
    // Define Conditions (in red)
    C1[Condition1] --> Entity2
    C2[Condition2] --> A1

    // Define Decision Variables (in purple)
    DV1[DecisionVar1] --> Entity1
    style DV1 fill:#purple,stroke-width:2px,color:white;

```

### Explanation:

- **Entities**: Represented as subgraphs with a blue color.
- **Attributes**: Listed and connected to their respective entities. They are in white.
- **Relations**: Shown as separate nodes connecting entities, colored orange.
- **Goals**: Connected to entities or attributes, colored green.
- **Conditions**: Linked to entities or attributes, colored red.
- **Decision Variables**: Associated with relevant entities, colored purple.

### Notes:

1. Adjust the entity names (`Entity1`, `Entity2`) and attribute names (`Attribute1`, etc.) as per your actual data.
2. Add more subgraphs for additional entities if needed.
3. Modify connections to reflect real-world relationships in your dataset.
4. You can customize node styles further if necessary.

This setup will create a visual representation of the data structure you described, using Mermaid.js syntax."
