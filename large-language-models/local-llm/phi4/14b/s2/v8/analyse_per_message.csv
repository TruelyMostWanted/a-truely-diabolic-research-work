Based on Entities.csv and Relationships.csv - Proceed and Create 3 individual CSV code-blocks (alternative: files) in chat named: Goals.csv + Conditions.csv + DecisionVariables.csv
Goals.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,IsSum,GoalType,EntityName,EntityAttribute,CriteriaType,Weight""
Conditions.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,IsSum,GoalType,EntityName,EntityAttribute,CriteriaType,Weight""
DecisionVariables.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,DataType,Domain,MinValue,MaxValue""

The following conventions must be applied:
ID starts with a letter G(oals), C(onditions), D(ecision)V(ariables) and a number follows, starting at 0, 1, 2, ....
Name is written snake_case
Names for Goals must begin with ""maximize_"" or ""minimize_""
IsSum is a boolean { True, False }
GoalType is one of { ""min"", ""max"" }
EntityName is always only 1 entry from the ""Name"" of Entities.csv
EntityAttribute is one of the values in the ""Attribute0"" to ""Attribute8"" of the targeted Entity in Entities.csv
CriteriaType is a number { 2 = Must-Match, 1 = May-Match, 0 = Cannot-Match }
Domain can represent set of values like ""{0,1}""
MinValue is the smallest value that can be set
MaxValue is the highest value that can be set
Weight is a mulptlier

Below is an example of how you can structure this graph:

```mermaid
graph TD

    %% Entities in blue
    subgraph ""Entities""
        E1([Entity1]):::entity
        E2([Entity2]):::entity
        E3([Entity3]):::entity
    end
    
    %% Attributes in white, around entities
    A1([Attribute1]):::attribute --> E1
    A2([Attribute2]):::attribute --> E1

    A4([Attribute4]):::attribute --> E3

### Explanation:

- **Entities**: Represented as blue nodes.
- **Attributes**: Connected to their respective entities and colored white.
- **Relations**: Orange lines connecting entities they relate.
- **Goals**: Green nodes connected to entities or attributes they pertain to.
- **Conditions**: Red nodes linked to specific entities or attributes.
- **Decision Variables**: Purple nodes associated with relevant entities.

### Customization:

Replace `Entity1`, `Attribute1`, etc., with your actual data. You can add more nodes and connections as needed by following the same pattern. This structure allows you to visualize complex relationships in a clear, color-coded manner using Mermaid.js."
