Based on Entities.csv and Relationships.csv - Proceed and Create 3 individual CSV code-blocks (alternative: files) in chat named: Goals.csv + Conditions.csv + DecisionVariables.csv
Goals.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,IsSum,GoalType,EntityName,EntityAttribute,CriteriaType,Weight""
Conditions.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,IsSum,GoalType,EntityName,EntityAttribute,CriteriaType,Weight""
DecisionVariables.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,DataType,Domain,MinValue,MaxValue""

The following conventions must be applied:
ID starts with a letter G(oals), C(onditions), D(ecision)V(ariables) and a number follows, starting at 0, 1, 2, ....
Name is written snake_case
Names for Goals must begin with ""maximize_"" or ""minimize_""
IsSum is a boolean { True, False }
GoalType is one of { ""min"", ""max"" }
EntityName is always only 1 entry from the ""Name"" of Entities.csv
EntityAttribute is one of the values in the ""Attribute0"" to ""Attribute8"" of the targeted Entity in Entities.csv
CriteriaType is a number { 2 = Must-Match, 1 = May-Match, 0 = Cannot-Match }
Domain can represent set of values like ""{0,1}""
MinValue is the smallest value that can be set
MaxValue is the highest value that can be set
Weight is a mulptlier

### Instructions to Use the Template:
1. **Entities**: Replace the placeholder text under ""Sets (Entities)"" with your specific entities and descriptions.
2. **Indices**: Similarly, update the ""Indices"" section with relevant index information from your data.
3. **Goals**: For each goal in your CSV, add an itemized list entry specifying its ID, name, mathematical representation, and logical description.
4. **Conditions**: Follow a similar approach for conditions, ensuring you provide both their IDs, names, mathematical formulations, and logical descriptions.
5. **Decision Variables**: List all decision variables with appropriate descriptions.

### Compiling the Document:
- Save this content in a `.tex` file.
- Use a LaTeX editor like Overleaf, TeXShop, or a command-line tool such as `pdflatex` to compile it into a PDF document.

This template provides a structured approach for presenting your optimization model data clearly and logically. Adjust the entries based on the specifics from your CSV files to complete the document."

### Explanation:

- **Entities**: Colored in blue.
  - `A[Entity1]`, `B[Entity2]`, `C[Entity3]`
  
- **Attributes**: Placed around their respective entities and colored in white.
  - `A1[Attribute1.1]`, `A2[Attribute1.2]` for Entity1
  - `B1[Attribute2.1]` for Entity2
  - `C1[Attribute3.1]` for Entity3

- **Relations**: Colored in orange.
  - `R1[Relation1]` connects Entity1 and Entity2
  - `R2[Relation2]` connects Entity2 and Entity3

- **Goals**: Colored in green, connected to entities or attributes.
  - `G1[Goal1]` connected to Attribute1.1
  - `G2[Goal2]` connected to Entity2

- **Conditions**: Colored in red, connected to entities or attributes.
  - `C1[Condition1]` connected to Attribute1.2
  - `C2[Condition2]` connected to Attribute2.1

- **Decision Variables**: Colored in purple, connected to relevant entities.
  - `DV1[DecisionVariable1]` connected to Entity1
  - `DV2[DecisionVariable2]` connected to Entity3

This structure should help you visualize the relationships and connections as specified. Adjust the node names and connections according to your actual data."
