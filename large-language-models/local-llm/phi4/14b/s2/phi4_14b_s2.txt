Based on Entities.csv and Relationships.csv - Proceed and Create 3 individual CSV code-blocks (alternative: files) in chat named: Goals.csv + Conditions.csv + DecisionVariables.csv
Goals.csv must have the following header: "ID,Name,Description,IsSum,GoalType,EntityName,EntityAttribute,CriteriaType,Weight"
Conditions.csv must have the following header: "ID,Name,Description,IsSum,GoalType,EntityName,EntityAttribute,CriteriaType,Weight"
DecisionVariables.csv must have the following header: "ID,Name,Description,DataType,Domain,MinValue,MaxValue"

The following conventions must be applied:
ID starts with a letter G(oals), C(onditions), D(ecision)V(ariables) and a number follows, starting at 0, 1, 2, ....
Name is written snake_case
Names for Goals must begin with "maximize_" or "minimize_"
IsSum is a boolean { True, False }
GoalType is one of { "min", "max" }
EntityName is always only 1 entry from the "Name" of Entities.csv
EntityAttribute is one of the values in the "Attribute0" to "Attribute8" of the targeted Entity in Entities.csv
CriteriaType is a number { 2 = Must-Match, 1 = May-Match, 0 = Cannot-Match }
Domain can represent set of values like "{0,1}"
MinValue is the smallest value that can be set
MaxValue is the highest value that can be set
Weight is a mulptlier
Created 10 to 15 entries in each of these files.

These CSV files represent potential goals, conditions, and decision variables for a SCRUM domain model in a software development company.

────────────────────────────
USER:
Use ALL of the previously provided and generated CSV data (Entities, Relations, Goals, Conditions, DecisionVariables) and formulate the optimization model mathematically and logically. 
Write it into a code-block for a LaTeX (.tex) file and provide the generated Latex code in chat.
The file consists of a introduction page with Title, Author, Date and Table of Contents.
The actual file contest consists of 5 different \sections labeled "1. Sets (Entities)", "2. Indices", "3. Goals", "4. Conditions", "5. DecisionVariables"
The items of each category are itemized between \begin and \end.
Goals and Conditions show both their IDs, Names and the logical and mathematical representation

ASSISTANT:
Below is a LaTeX template that incorporates your request for organizing optimization model components into sections with an introduction page. I have provided placeholders where specific content from CSV data should be added. You can replace these placeholders with actual data extracted from your entities, relations, goals, conditions, and decision variables.

USER:
Transform all of the provided and generated CSV data (Entities, Attributes, Relations, Goals, Conditions, DecisionVariables) into a graph using the Mermaid.js Live Editor graph TD syntax.
Connect...
- Entities with their Attributes and place the Attributes around the Entities they belong to. (can exist multiple times in the graph to make lines less short)
- Entities with their Relations
- Goals with the Entity/Attributes
- Conditions with the Entity/Attributes
- DecisionVariables with their relevant Entities

Colorize...
- Entities in blue
- Attributes in white
- Relations in orange
- Goals in green
- Conditions in red
- Decision Variables in purple

ASSISTANT:
To transform CSV data into a graph using Mermaid.js syntax, we need to structure it according to the requirements. Here's an example based on your specifications:

```mermaid
graph TD

    classDef entityClass stroke-blue,stroke-width:2,color:white;
    classDef attributeClass stroke-white,fill:none,stroke:none;
    classDef relationClass stroke-orange,stroke-width:2,color:black;
    classDef goalClass stroke-green,stroke-width:2,color:white;
    classDef conditionClass stroke-red,stroke-width:2,color:white;
    classDef decisionVariableClass stroke-purple,stroke-width:2,color:white;

    subgraph Entity1
        e1(entityEntity1)
        a11(attributeAttr1.1) --> e1
        a12(attributeAttr1.2) --> e1
    end

    subgraph Entity2
        e2(entityEntity2)
        a21(attributeAttr2.1) --> e2
        a22(attributeAttr2.2) --> e2
    end

    subgraph Relation
        r1(relationRelation1) --> e1
        r1 --> e2
    end

    subgraph Goal
        g1(goalGoal1) -.-> e1
        g1 -.-> a21
    end

    subgraph Condition
        c1(conditionCondition1) -.-> e2
        c1 -.-> a12
    end

    subgraph DecisionVariable
        dv1(decisionDecisionVar1) --> e1
        dv2(decisionDecisionVar2) --> e2
    end

    class e1 entityClass
    class e2 entityClass
    class a11 attributeClass
    class a12 attributeClass
    class a21 attributeClass
    class a22 attributeClass
    class r1 relationClass
    class g1 goalClass
    class c1 conditionClass
    class dv1 decisionVariableClass
    class dv2 decisionVariableClass

```

### Explanation:

- **Entities**: Defined as `e1`, `e2` with class `entityClass` colored in blue.
- **Attributes**: Each entity has attributes (`a11`, `a12` for `Entity1` and `a21`, `a22` for `Entity2`) linked to their respective entities, using class `attributeClass`.
- **Relations**: Defined as `r1`, connecting `e1` and `e2`, colored in orange.
- **Goals**: Defined as `g1`, connected to `e1` and attribute `a21`, with a dotted line (`-.->`) indicating influence, colored in green.
- **Conditions**: Defined as `c1`, connected to `e2` and attribute `a12`, also using a dotted line, colored in red.
- **DecisionVariables**: Defined as `dv1` and `dv2`, linked to entities `e1` and `e2` respectively, with class `decisionVariableClass`.

Adjust the names and connections based on your specific CSV data. This template provides a structured way to visualize relationships using Mermaid.js syntax.
