\section{Problem Definition}
The main goal is to balance efficiency, productivity, and team satisfaction while delivering high-quality software products within project scope and timelines. Minimize or maximize an objective function (depending on specific goals) subject to constraints defined by relationships and decision variables.

\section{Objective Functions}

1. Optimize Team Composition:
\[
\text{{Maximize}} \ \sum_{i=1}^{n} team\_assignment[i] \times skill\_distribution[i] \times workload\_balance[i]
\]
2. Optimize Skill Level Distribution:
\[
\text{{Minimize}} \ \sum_{i=1}^{m} (skill\_distribution[i] - 0.5)^2
\]
3. Optimize Workload Balancing:
\[
\text{{Minimize}} \ \sum_{i=1}^{m} |workload\_balance[i] - 100|
\]
4. Optimize Time Management Efficiency:
\[
\text{{Minimize}} \ \sum_{i=1}^{k} meeting\_efficiency[i] \times 100
\]
5. Optimize Requirements Clarity:
\[
\text{{Maximize}} \ \sum_{j=1}^{l} requirements\_clarity[j] \times 100
\]
6. Optimize Scope Control:
\[
\text{{Minimize}} \ \sum_{j=1}^{l} scope\_impact[j] \times (scope\_change[j] - 1)
\]
7. Optimize Backlog Management:
\[
\text{{Maximize}} \ \sum_{i=1}^{m} backlog\_management[i] \times 100
\]
8. Optimize Release Planning:
\[
\text{{Minimize}} \ \sum_{p=1}^{o} delay[p] + \sum_{q=1}^{r} success[q]
\]
9. Optimize Velocity Optimization:
\[
\text{{Maximize}} \ \sum_{i=1}^{m} velocity\_optimization[i] \times 100
\]

\section{Constraints}
1. Each team is assigned to at most one project (`team_assignment[i]` binary):
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n} team\_assignment[i] = m, \quad \forall i, team\_assignment[i] \in \{0, 1\}
\]
2. If `team_assignment[i] = 1`, then the team has sufficient skills to perform tasks for that project (based on related entities and decision variables):
\[
skills\_required[i] \leq \sum_{j=1}^{l} skill\_level[j], \quad \forall i, \text{{if}} \ team\_assignment[i] = 1
\]
3. Scope control: User stories cannot exceed project scope or have unplanned scope changes (based on related entities and decision variables):
\[
\sum_{j=1}^{l} impact[j] \times scope\_change[j] \leq scope, \quad \forall i
\]
4. Backlog management: The product backlog must be well-organized, up-to-date, and prioritized effectively (based on related entities and decision variables):
\[
backlog\_quality[i] \geq quality\_threshold, \quad \forall i
\]
5. Release planning: Releases should be planned effectively to minimize disruptions and maximize benefits (based on related entities and decision variables):
\[
\sum_{p=1}^{o} release\_impact[p] \times delay[p] \leq disruption, \quad \forall i
\]
6. Velocity optimization: The team's velocity should be balanced to maintain a healthy work environment (based on related entities and decision variables):
\[
velocity\_optimization[i] \geq velocity\_threshold, \quad \forall i
\]
