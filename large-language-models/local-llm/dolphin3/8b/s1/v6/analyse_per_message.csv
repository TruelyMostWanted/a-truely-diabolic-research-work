1. **Extracting Requirements**: NLP techniques like Named Entity Recognition (NER) can help identify key entities in text, including user stories, acceptance criteria, and features. For example, ""As a [user], I want to [perform an action] so that [some goal].""

2. **Structuring Requirements**: Once the requirements are identified, they can be structured using techniques such as dependency parsing or semantic role labeling (SRL). These help to understand the relationships between different parts of text, e.g., identifying dependencies between user stories and how they might fit into a larger system.

3. **Evaluating Complexity**: NLP methods like sentiment analysis can evaluate the complexity of requirements by assessing the degree of uncertainty, ambiguity, or conflict present in the text. For instance, if multiple stakeholders have differing opinions on a requirement's scope or priority.

To illustrate this process with a simplified CSV format for Scrum-related entities:

```csv
Keyword, Category, Description, RelevantScrumEntities
User Story, Requirement, As an [User], I want to [Action] so that [Goal], Product Owner, Development Team, Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance Criteria, Requirement, To satisfy the acceptance criteria, [Conditions/Requirements] must be met, Product Owner, Quality Assurance
Feature, Requirement, A major functionality of the software, e.g., Chatbot feature or Payment gateway integration, Product Owner, Development Team
User Role, Entity, Represents a type of user within the system, e.g., Customer, Admin, Guest, Business Analyst
Action, Action, What the user does to perform an action related to the requirement, e.g., ""Search for products"", UI/UX Designer
Goal, Objective, The desired outcome/result after performing an action or completing a story/task, Product Owner, Stakeholder
Dependency, Relationship, Indicates that one feature or requirement relies on another, Product Owner, Development Team
Burden, Metric, A measure of the complexity or effort required to implement a user story, e.g., points, complexity level, Project Manager/Scrum Master
Requirement Type, Categorization, Describes the nature or type of requirement, e.g., Functional, Non-Functional, Business Analyst

- Deadlines: Meeting project deadlines can create significant stress for developers.
- Complexity: Complex tasks or projects may cause mental strain on developers.
- Uncertainty: Unpredictable requirements or changes in the project scope can lead to increased pressure.
- Evaluation and feedback: Continuous evaluation and critical feedback from managers, peers, or clients can contribute to cognitive pressure.

% Entities (blue)
entity1((Entity 1)) -.Attributes->[Attribute 1]->. Attributes -[Relations]-> entity2((Entity 2))
entity3((Entity 3))

% Attributes (white)
subgraph Attributes

% Conditions (red)

% Decision Variables (purple)

entity1 --> relation1 --> entity3
entity2 --(Relation 2)--> goal1
attribute1 -.Condition->[Condition 1]-> condition1
decisionVar1 -.Relates to->[Goal 1, Relation 2]--> entity1

```

In this example:

- Entities are represented as nodes with blue borders.
- Attributes are shown in white nodes and placed around their respective entities.
- Relations are depicted as orange arrows between entities.
- Goals are green shapes connected to the relevant entity or attribute.
- Conditions are red shapes connected to the relevant attribute.
- Decision Variables are purple shapes connected to their related elements.

Please adapt this template according to your specific data, ensuring that each entity and attribute has its own unique name. You can expand this graph by adding more entities, attributes, relations, goals, conditions, and decision variables as needed, adjusting the Mermaid syntax accordingly."
