Extracting System Requirements:\n- NLP can be used to extract key information from unstructured text sources such as project documentation, meeting minutes, or email threads.\n- Named Entity Recognition (NER) techniques in NLP help identify and classify entities mentioned in the text like features, user roles, functional requirements, non-functional requirements, etc.\n\n2. Structuring System Requirements:\n- After identifying these entities, they can be structured into a format suitable for managing requirements in an Agile project.\n- This information can be used to create Backlog items (User Stories or Epics) and prioritize them based on business value and complexity.\n\n3. Evaluating System Complexity:\n- NLP techniques such as Text Analysis and Sentiment Analysis can help evaluate the complexity of system requirements by analyzing the language used in the requirement descriptions.\n- This analysis can reveal areas that need more attention due to high complexity or ambiguity, helping the development team plan resources better.\n\nHere is a CSV file with headers \"Keyword\", \"Category\", \"Description\", and \"RelevantScrumEntities\":\n\n```csv\nKeyword, Category, Description, RelevantScrumEntities\nUser Stories, Requirement Type, A description of a feature from an end user's perspective, Product Owner, Scrum Team\nEpic, Requirement Type, Large User Story that might be split into smaller ones, Product Owner, Scrum Team\nFunctional Requirements, System Behavior, What the system should do, Business Analyst, Technical Team\nNon-Functional Requirements, System Quality, Constraints on the system performance or behavior, Business Analyst, Technical Team\nPriority, Requirement Attribute, The order of importance for a requirement, Product Owner, Scrum Master\nEffort Estimate, Requirement Attribute, An estimate of the work effort required to implement a requirement, Scrum Team, Project Manager\n```\n\nIn this context, Natural Language Processing can be instrumental in transforming unstructured data into structured and actionable requirements that can help teams like the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Scrum Team make informed decisions for better project management."
