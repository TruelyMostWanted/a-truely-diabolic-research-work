It can be utilized for extracting, structuring, and evaluating system requirements and their complexity.

Here are some ways NLP is useful in this context:

1. **Keyword Extraction**: It involves identifying important words or phrases from the text to characterize the document. For instance, if a requirement mentions ""user authentication,"" that keyword could be extracted by the AI for further analysis.

2. **Category Identification**: The system requirements can be categorized into different types like Functional, Non-functional, Technical, Business, etc. based on their purpose in the software development process. NLP algorithms can identify these categories and prioritize them according to project needs.

3. **Description Analysis**: The description of each requirement could contain complex sentences and technical jargon. NLP can simplify this by breaking down complex sentences into simpler ones and translating technical terms into layman's language for better understanding.

4. **Relevant Scrum Entities Identification**: Scrum entities like Product Owner, Scrum Master, Developers, etc., need to be involved in the requirement gathering process based on their expertise and availability. NLP can identify these entities from the requirements' text and suggest relevant team members.
