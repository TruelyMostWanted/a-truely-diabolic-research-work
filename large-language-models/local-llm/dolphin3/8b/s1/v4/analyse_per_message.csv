This Python script generates random data and creates the following CSV files:

1. Goals.csv: Contains 15 goals with their respective descriptions, sums, goal types, entity names, attributes, criteria types, and weights.

2. Conditions.csv: Contains 15 conditions with their respective descriptions, sums, goal types, entity names, attributes, criteria types, and weights.

3. DecisionVariables.csv: Contains 15 decision variables with their respective descriptions, data types, domains, minimum values, maximum values, and weights."

\newpage
\section*{1. Problem/Model Description}
In this section we will describe the problem or model that we want to optimize.

% Section 2 content.
\section*{2. Sets (Entities)}
Here, we define the entities involved in our optimization model. For instance, let $I$ be the set of all possible options for a decision variable.

\begin{itemize}
    \item $I$: Set of all possible options.
\end{itemize}

% Section 3 content.
\section*{3. Indices}
Here, we define indices that will be used throughout our model to specify particular elements from the sets established in section 2.

% Section 4 content.
\section*{4. Goals}
In this part of the document, we describe the optimization goals which could be either minimizing or maximizing an objective function.

% Section 5 content.
\section*{5. Conditions}
This section includes any necessary conditions that must be satisfied for the model to remain valid and feasible.

% Section 6 content.
\section*{6. DecisionVariables}
Here, we list all decision variables and specify their domains or allowed values.

% Section 7 content.
\section*{7. Possible Model Extension(s)}
In this part of the document, discuss potential extensions to the model that may be beneficial for future use.
