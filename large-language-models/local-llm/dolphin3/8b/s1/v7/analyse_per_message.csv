System requirements often come in unstructured forms like text documents or verbal discussions, which makes it challenging to extract relevant information. NLP can help in this situation by providing ways to identify, categorize, and prioritize these requirements.

1. Extracting Requirements: The first step involves identifying keywords or phrases that indicate system requirements. This could involve using techniques such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) which can be trained on specific requirement documents.

2. Structuring Requirements: Once the requirements are identified, NLP can help in structuring them into a format that's easily understandable and manageable by the development team. For example, it could transform free text descriptions into structured format with attributes like ""Requirement ID"", ""Category"", ""Description"", ""Priority"", etc.

3. Evaluating Complexity: NLP can also be used to analyze the complexity of requirements. This could involve analyzing the length of the requirement description, or even more sophisticated methods such as using word embeddings to understand the semantic complexity.

4. Relevant Scrum Entities: These are the entities that participate in different events and artifacts within a Scrum framework. For example, Product Owner, Scrum Master, Team Members, Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment etc. NLP can help map system requirements with these entities.

Here's an example of how this information could be represented in a CSV file:

```csv
Keyword, Category, Description, RelevantScrumEntities
Requirement ID, Identifier, A unique identifier for each requirement, None
Title, Identifier, Brief title of the requirement, None
Description, Text, Detailed description of the requirement, None
Priority, Numerical/Text, The priority level of the requirement, None
Category, Categorical, The category to which the requirement belongs, e.g. UI, Functional, Non-functional
Estimated Effort, Numerical, An estimate of the effort required to implement the requirement, Team Members
Complexity Index, Numerical, A measure of the complexity of implementing the requirement, Product Owner, Scrum Master
Status, Text, The current status of the requirement e.g. To Do, In Progress, Done, None
```

This structure allows easy mapping between requirements and relevant entities in a Scrum framework. For example, the ""Estimated Effort"" can be used by Team Members to plan their work, while the ""Complexity Index"" might be used by Product Owner and Scrum Master for prioritization.

In real-world scenarios, a more advanced NLP pipeline would be required, including tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing etc. Additionally, machine learning algorithms could be applied to improve the accuracy of these tasks over time based on historical data."

These include but are not limited to:

- Unrealistic deadlines or expectations
- Constant changes in project scope or requirements
- Insufficient training or resources for tasks
- Lack of clear communication between team members and stakeholders
- High level of responsibility or accountability
- Working long hours or excessive workload

Here is a CSV code block that represents these factors along with their potential influence on cognitive pressure and stress development:

```csv
ID, Name, Description, AffectedEntities, Influence
1, Unrealistic Deadlines, Excessive time pressure can lead to increased cognitive load and stress, Developers, High

4, Poor Communication, Inadequate information sharing can lead to misunderstandings and increased cognitive effort, Developers & Stakeholders, High
5, High Responsibility, Excessive accountability can create fear of failure and increase stress levels, Developers, High
6, Long Working Hours, Prolonged working hours may result in physical and mental exhaustion, Developers, High
```

These factors can have a significant impact on the well-being and productivity of team members, therefore it's important to address them promptly."

\end{itemize}

% Optimization model formulation
\section*{Optimization Model Formulation}
Given the entities, indices, goals, conditions, and decision variables defined above, we aim to maximize the level of helpfulness in responses (D1) while minimizing response generation time (D2). The optimization problem can be represented mathematically as follows:

Objective Function:
\begin{align*}
    \text{Maximize} & \quad D1 \\
    \text{Minimize} & \quad D2
\end{align*}

Subject to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The AI assistant (Dolphin) is active and available to assist the user, given condition C1.
    \item User queries are clear, concise, and relevant to the AI's capabilities, given condition C2.
    \item All constraints related to goals G1 and G2.
\end{itemize}

You can use any CSV parsing library such as Papa Parse or csv-parser for this purpose.

Once you have implemented the necessary logic, you can run the code snippet to generate and visualize your graph using Mermaid.js Live Editor."
