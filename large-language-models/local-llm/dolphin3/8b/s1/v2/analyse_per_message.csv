Here is how NLP can be used to extract, structure and evaluate system requirements and their complexity:

1. Extraction: Natural Language processing algorithms such as Tokenization, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Part-of-Speech Tagging (POS) can be employed for extracting relevant information from unstructured text data. For instance, keyword extraction tools like TF-IDF or TextRank can help in identifying the most important words or phrases related to software requirements.

2. Structuring: Once the keywords are extracted, they need to be structured properly for better comprehension and management. For this purpose, NLP techniques such as dependency parsing and Constituents Syntax Parsing (CSP) can be helpful. These methods provide a clear understanding of the relationships between different entities in the text.

3. Evaluation: Estimation of effort required for implementing a requirement is crucial in project planning. Here, NLP methods like sentiment analysis or opinion mining can be used to analyze the requirements' documents. By studying these analyses, we could make an early estimation about how complex a certain requirement may turn out to be during its implementation.

- Tight deadlines: Scrum emphasizes delivering working software in short iterations. This can create pressure on the team to complete tasks within these tight timeframes.
- High expectations: The product owner's expectations or the team's own high performance goals may lead to increased stress when these are not met promptly.
- Changing requirements: Frequent changes in user stories or priorities can result in confusion and increase the workload of developers, leading to pressure.
- Insufficient resources: When a project is under-resourced, either in terms of human power or budget, it creates an environment where team members feel pressured to deliver more than they are able to.

The following table represents these factors with their respective influences on cognitive pressure and stress development:

ID | Name | Description | Affected Entities | Influence
---|------|-------------|------------------|-----------
1  | Tight Deadlines | The need to complete tasks in short iterations can create a stressful environment. | Developers, Product Owners | 9 (High)
2  | High Expectations | Setting unrealistic goals for the team may result in increased pressure and stress. | Team members | 8 (Moderate High)
3  | Changing Requirements | Constant changes in user stories or priorities can disrupt work processes and increase stress levels. | Developers, Product Owners | 7 (Moderate)
4  | Insufficient Resources | Under-resourcing a project creates an environment where team members feel pressured to deliver more than they are able to. | Team members, Project Managers | 6 (Moderate)

These factors can significantly impact the cognitive pressure and stress development within a scrum-based software-development team."

% Section 1: Problem/Model Description
\section{1. Problem/Model Description}
In this section, we provide a detailed explanation and description of the problem we are trying to optimize, along with the objectives of our model.

% Section 2: Sets (Entities)
\section{2. Sets (Entities)}
Here, we define all entities involved in the optimization problem. These can include different categories, groups or classifications within the system.

% Section 3: Indices
\section{3. Indices}
This section provides an explanation and definition of indices used throughout the model. Indices are variables that help to identify specific elements in relation to other elements.

% Section 4: Goals
\section{4. Goals}
In this section, we define the main objectives or goals of the optimization model. These are the targets that the model aims to achieve.

% Section 5: Conditions
\section{5. Conditions}
Conditions represent any constraints, limitations or rules that must be adhered to within the system. This section defines these conditions and how they impact the optimization process.

% Section 6: Decision Variables
\section{6. Decision Variables}
Decision variables are the input parameters of the model that can be controlled and adjusted in order to optimize the objective function. In this section, we describe each decision variable and its role within the model.

% Section 7: Possible Model Extension(s)
\section{7. Possible Model Extension(s)}
This final section discusses possible ways of extending or improving the optimization model. This could involve incorporating additional variables, refining existing constraints, or adjusting objectives to better suit specific needs.

The provided LaTeX code above creates a basic document structure for an Optimization Model Formulation consisting of seven sections as requested: ""1. Problem/Model Description"", ""2. Sets (Entities)"", ""3. Indices"", ""4. Goals"", ""5. Conditions"", ""6. Decision Variables"" and ""7. Possible Model Extension(s)"". The model description, sets, indices, goals, conditions, decision variables, and potential extensions of the optimization model are structured in these respective sections.

Note: This LaTeX template is a starting point for creating an optimization model formulation document. Depending on your specific requirements, you may need to add more content, modify existing sections or even create additional sections based on your unique needs."

You can copy and paste this code into the Mermaid.js Live Editor at https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor.html to see how it looks. Remember that you'll need to replace the placeholders with your actual data.

Note: The graph may become cluttered if there are too many entities, attributes, relations, goals, conditions, or decision variables. In that case, you might want to create separate graphs for different parts of the data."
