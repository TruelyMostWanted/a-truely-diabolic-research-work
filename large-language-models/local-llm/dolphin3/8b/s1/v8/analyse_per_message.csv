Here are some key areas where NLP can make a significant impact:

1. Requirement extraction: Using NLP algorithms, we can identify and extract specific terms or phrases that represent system requirements from unstructured text documents such as project proposals, business analysis reports, or customer feedback.

2. Requirement structuring: NLP techniques like dependency parsing and Named Entity Recognition (NER) can be applied to create structured representations of extracted requirements in a more readable and understandable format for stakeholders involved in the software development process.

3. Complexity evaluation: We can employ NLP methods such as text classification, sentiment analysis or deep learning-based models to evaluate the complexity of system requirements based on factors like ambiguity, size, dependencies among other aspects.

To represent this information in CSV format with header ""Keyword, Category, Description, RelevantScrumEntities"", here's a sample content:

Some of these include:

Factors:
1. Unrealistic expectations: Expectations regarding project completion time or quality can create significant pressure on team members.
2. Tight deadlines: Working under strict deadlines can cause an excessive workload, leading to stress and burnout.
3. Unclear requirements: When the requirements are not clearly defined, team members may feel anxious about making incorrect assumptions.

Forms:
1. Team conflicts: Disagreements or misunderstandings between team members can create a tense environment, causing stress.
2. Work overload: Excessive workload due to inadequate task distribution or lack of resources can put significant pressure on team members.
3. Lack of recognition: Not acknowledging the efforts and accomplishments of team members can lead to dissatisfaction and increased stress.
