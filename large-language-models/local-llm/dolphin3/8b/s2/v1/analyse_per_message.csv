Based on Entities.csv and Relationships.csv - Proceed and Create 3 individual CSV code-blocks (alternative: files) in chat named: Goals.csv + Conditions.csv + DecisionVariables.csv
Goals.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,IsSum,GoalType,EntityName,EntityAttribute,CriteriaType,Weight""
Conditions.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,IsSum,GoalType,EntityName,EntityAttribute,CriteriaType,Weight""
DecisionVariables.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,DataType,Domain,MinValue,MaxValue""

The following conventions must be applied:
ID starts with a letter G(oals), C(onditions), D(ecision)V(ariables) and a number follows, starting at 0, 1, 2, ....
Name is written snake_case
Names for Goals must begin with ""maximize_"" or ""minimize_""
IsSum is a boolean { True, False }
GoalType is one of { ""min"", ""max"" }
EntityName is always only 1 entry from the ""Name"" of Entities.csv
EntityAttribute is one of the values in the ""Attribute0"" to ""Attribute8"" of the targeted Entity in Entities.csv
CriteriaType is a number { 2 = Must-Match, 1 = May-Match, 0 = Cannot-Match }
Domain can represent set of values like ""{0,1}""
MinValue is the smallest value that can be set
MaxValue is the highest value that can be set
Weight is a mulptlier
Created 10 to 15 entries in each of these files."
