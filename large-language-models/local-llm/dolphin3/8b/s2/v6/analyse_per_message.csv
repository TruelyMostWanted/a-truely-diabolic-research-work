Based on Entities.csv and Relationships.csv - Proceed and Create 3 individual CSV code-blocks (alternative: files) in chat named: Goals.csv + Conditions.csv + DecisionVariables.csv
Goals.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,IsSum,GoalType,EntityName,EntityAttribute,CriteriaType,Weight""
Conditions.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,IsSum,GoalType,EntityName,EntityAttribute,CriteriaType,Weight""
DecisionVariables.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,DataType,Domain,MinValue,MaxValue""

The following conventions must be applied:
ID starts with a letter G(oals), C(onditions), D(ecision)V(ariables) and a number follows, starting at 0, 1, 2, ....
Name is written snake_case
Names for Goals must begin with ""maximize_"" or ""minimize_""
IsSum is a boolean { True, False }
GoalType is one of { ""min"", ""max"" }
EntityName is always only 1 entry from the ""Name"" of Entities.csv
EntityAttribute is one of the values in the ""Attribute0"" to ""Attribute8"" of the targeted Entity in Entities.csv
CriteriaType is a number { 2 = Must-Match, 1 = May-Match, 0 = Cannot-Match }
Domain can represent set of values like ""{0,1}""
MinValue is the smallest value that can be set
MaxValue is the highest value that can be set
Weight is a mulptlier

I will create a LaTeX code block for your optimization model based on the previously provided CSV data.

First, let's define some sets:

\setlength{\leftskip}{0pt}
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbf{E}.\arabic*.]
    \item[1] \emph{Entities}: Set $I$ contains all entities.
    \item[2] \emph{Indices}: Set $J$ represents the set of indices.
    \item[3] \emph{Goals}: Set $K$ includes all goals.
    \item[4] \emph{Conditions}: Set $L$ denotes the conditions.
    \item[5] \emph{Decision Variables}: Set $M$ comprises decision variables.
\end{itemize}
\setlength{\leftskip}{0pt}

Now, let's represent the logical and mathematical representation of Goals and Conditions.

\begin{itemize}[label=\textbf{G}.\arabic*.]
    \item[1] \emph{Goal 1}: $z_1 = z_{11}$ (Logical: ID = 1, Name = Goal 1)
    \item[2] \emph{Goal 2}: $z_2 = z_{21}$ (Logical: ID = 2, Name = Goal 2)
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}[label=\textbf{C}.\arabic*.]
    \item[1] \emph{Condition 1}: $c_1$ (ID = 1, Name = Condition 1)
    \item[2] \emph{Condition 2}: $c_2$ (ID = 2, Name = Condition 2)
\end{itemize}

Finally, let's define the optimization model.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text{Minimize} & & z = \sum_{i \in I} x_i \\
& \text{Subject to:} & & c_1 = \text{True} \\
& & & c_2 = \text{True} \\
& & & g_1 \leq M_1 \\
& & & g_2 \leq M_2
\end{aligned}
$$

Here, $x_i$ represents the decision variables for each entity in set $I$, and $g_1$ and $g_2$ represent the goals. The conditions $c_1$ and $c_2$ are included as constraints.

Please note that this is just an example of how your optimization model could be formulated mathematically and logically based on the provided data. You may need to modify it according to your specific problem requirements."
