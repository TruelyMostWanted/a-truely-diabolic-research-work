Based on Entities.csv and Relationships.csv - Proceed and Create 3 individual CSV code-blocks (alternative: files) in chat named: Goals.csv + Conditions.csv + DecisionVariables.csv
Goals.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,IsSum,GoalType,EntityName,EntityAttribute,CriteriaType,Weight""
Conditions.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,IsSum,GoalType,EntityName,EntityAttribute,CriteriaType,Weight""
DecisionVariables.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,DataType,Domain,MinValue,MaxValue""

The following conventions must be applied:
ID starts with a letter G(oals), C(onditions), D(ecision)V(ariables) and a number follows, starting at 0, 1, 2, ....
Name is written snake_case
Names for Goals must begin with ""maximize_"" or ""minimize_""
IsSum is a boolean { True, False }
GoalType is one of { ""min"", ""max"" }
EntityName is always only 1 entry from the ""Name"" of Entities.csv
EntityAttribute is one of the values in the ""Attribute0"" to ""Attribute8"" of the targeted Entity in Entities.csv
CriteriaType is a number { 2 = Must-Match, 1 = May-Match, 0 = Cannot-Match }
Domain can represent set of values like ""{0,1}""
MinValue is the smallest value that can be set
MaxValue is the highest value that can be set
Weight is a mulptlier

\section{1. Sets (Entities)}
The optimization model consists of several entities, which are defined as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Customer: $C = \{c_1, c_2, ..., c_n\}$.
    \item Product: $P = \{p_1, p_2, ..., p_m\}$.
    \item Supplier: $S = \{s_1, s_2, ..., s_l\}$.
\end{enumerate}

\section{2. Indices}
The indices used in the optimization model are defined as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Time periods: $t = 1, 2, ..., T$.
    \item Batch quantities: $i = 1, 2, ..., I$.
\end{enumerate}

\section{3. Goals}
The goals of the optimization model are defined as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Minimize total cost: 
        \[
        \text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \left( \sum_{s \in S} f_s(t) + \sum_{c \in C} g_c(t) \right)
        \]
    \item Maximize customer satisfaction: 
        \[
        \text{Maximize } U = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \left( \sum_{c \in C} u_c(t) \right)
        \]
\end{enumerate}

\section{4. Conditions}
The conditions of the optimization model are defined as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Demand constraints: 
        \[
        0 \leq d_{ct}(t) \leq c_q(c), \quad \forall c \in C, \; \forall t
        \]
    \item Inventory level constraints: 
        \[
        i_p(p,t-1) + q_{pt}(t) - d_{ct}(t) \geq 0, \quad \forall p \in P, \; \forall t > 1
        \]
    \item Supply constraints:
        \[
        f_s(t) \leq s_s(s,t), \quad \forall s \in S, \; \forall t
        \]
\end{enumerate}

\section{5. DecisionVariables}
The decision variables of the optimization model are defined as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Order quantities: $x_{c}(t)$ for each customer c and time period t.
    \item Production quantities: $y_{p}(i,t)$ for each product p, batch quantity i, and time period t.
    \item Transportation quantities: $z_{sp}(t)$ for each supplier s, product p, and time period t.
\end{enumerate}
