Goals}\nThe goals of the optimization model are defined as follows:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item Minimize total cost: \n        \\[\n        \\text{Minimize } Z = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\left( \\sum_{s \\in S} f_s(t) + \\sum_{c \\in C} g_c(t) \\right)\n        \\]\n    \\item Maximize customer satisfaction: \n        \\[\n        \\text{Maximize } U = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\left( \\sum_{c \\in C} u_c(t) \\right)\n        \\]\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\section{4.
