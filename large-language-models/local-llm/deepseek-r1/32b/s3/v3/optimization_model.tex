\section{Goals}
1. Maximize Sprint Velocity:
   \[
   \max_{e} \sum_{r} v_e
   \]
2. Minimize Blocker Severity:
   \[
   \min_{c} \sum_{k} s_c
   \]

... (Additional goals listed similarly)

\section{Conditions}
1. Team Availability Constraint:
   \[
   \forall j, k: a_j + b_k \geq 1
   \]
2. Sprint Goal Achievement:
   \[
   \forall r, x: c_r \geq d_x
   \]

... (Additional conditions listed similarly)

\section{Decision Variables}
1. Worker Assignment (\( w_{jk} \)):
   \[
   w_{jk} \in \{0, 1\}
   \]
2. Effort Allocation (\( e_a \)):
   \[
   e_a \in [10, 40]
   \]

... (Additional decision variables listed similarly)
