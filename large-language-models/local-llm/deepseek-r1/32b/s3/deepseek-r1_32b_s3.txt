Based on Entities.csv and Relationships.csv - Proceed and Create 3 individual CSV code-blocks (alternative: files) in chat named: Goals.csv + Conditions.csv + DecisionVariables.csv
Goals.csv must have the following header: "ID,Name,Description,IsSum,GoalType,EntityName,EntityAttribute,CriteriaType,Weight"
Conditions.csv must have the following header: "ID,Name,Description,IsSum,GoalType,EntityName,EntityAttribute,CriteriaType,Weight"
DecisionVariables.csv must have the following header: "ID,Name,Description,DataType,Domain,MinValue,MaxValue"

The following conventions must be applied:
ID starts with a letter G(oals), C(onditions), D(ecision)V(ariables) and a number follows, starting at 0, 1, 2, ....
Name is written snake_case
Names for Goals must begin with "maximize_" or "minimize_"
IsSum is a boolean { True, False }
GoalType is one of { "min", "max" }
EntityName is always only 1 entry from the "Name" of Entities.csv
EntityAttribute is one of the values in the "Attribute0" to "Attribute8" of the targeted Entity in Entities.csv
CriteriaType is a number { 2 = Must-Match, 1 = May-Match, 0 = Cannot-Match }
Domain can represent set of values like "{0,1}"
MinValue is the smallest value that can be set
MaxValue is the highest value that can be set
Weight is a mulptlier
Created 10 to 15 entries in each of these files.

Use ALL of the previously provided and generated CSV data (Entities, Relations, Goals, Conditions, DecisionVariables) and formulate the optimization model mathematically and logically. 
Write it into a code-block for a LaTeX (.tex) file and provide the generated Latex code in chat.
The file consists of a introduction page with Title, Author, Date and Table of Contents.
The actual file contest consists of 5 different \sections labeled "1. Sets (Entities)", "2. Indices", "3. Goals", "4. Conditions", "5. DecisionVariables"
The items of each category are itemized between \begin and \end.
Goals and Conditions show both their IDs, Names and the logical and mathematical representation

Transform all of the provided and generated CSV data (Entities, Attributes, Relations, Goals, Conditions, DecisionVariables) into a graph using the Mermaid.js Live Editor graph TD syntax.
Connect...
- Entities with their Attributes and place the Attributes around the Entities they belong to. (can exist multiple times in the graph to make lines less short)
- Entities with their Relations
- Goals with the Entity/Attributes
- Conditions with the Entity/Attributes
- DecisionVariables with their relevant Entities

Colorize...
- Entities in blue
- Attributes in white
- Relations in orange
- Goals in green
- Conditions in red
- Decision Variables in purple

Provide all 5 code-blocks (files) in chat:
3 Comma-Seperated-Values (csv), 1 LaTeX (tex), 1 Mermaid (mmd)

<think>
Alright, I need to figure out how to respond to this user's query. They provided a detailed scenario about creating CSV files for Goals, Conditions, and Decision Variables based on given Entities and Relationships. Then, they want me to generate a LaTeX document and a Mermaid graph.

First, I should parse the userâ€™s requirements carefully. They mentioned using specific headers for each CSV file and following certain conventions for IDs, names, and other fields. The LaTeX document needs sections for Sets, Indices, Goals, Conditions, and Decision Variables, each itemized with their mathematical representations.

I notice that the user included example responses, so I can use those as a template. My task is to create similar CSV files, ensuring all entities are covered, and then transform them into the required LaTeX structure. Additionally, generating the Mermaid graph with specific colors and connections seems complex but manageable by mapping each component correctly.

I should start by extracting relevant attributes from the Entities.csv for Goals and Conditions, making sure to link them properly using the Relationships.csv. For Decision Variables, I need to define variables that influence the optimization model, ensuring they have appropriate data types and domains.

Next, when creating the LaTeX document, I'll structure each section with itemized lists, clearly showing IDs, names, and mathematical expressions for Goals and Conditions. For Decision Variables, I'll include their descriptions and possible values.

Finally, the Mermaid graph requires careful mapping of all entities, attributes, relationships, goals, conditions, and decision variables, each colored appropriately to enhance readability. I need to ensure that connections are accurate, reflecting the actual data flow and dependencies as per the provided CSVs.

Throughout this process, I must maintain attention to detail to meet all specified conventions and formatting requirements, ensuring that the output is both correct and comprehensively covers all aspects of the problem.

I'll help you create the required files step by step. Let's start with the **Goals.csv**, **Conditions.csv**, and **DecisionVariables.csv** files based on the provided entities and relationships.
