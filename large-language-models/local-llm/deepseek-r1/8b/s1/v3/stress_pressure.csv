ID,Name,Description,AffectedEntities,Influence
1,Overly Ambitious Product Backlog,The product backlog contains too many or prioritized items that stretch team capacity beyond sustainable limits.,Product Owner,Team Members,Scrum Master,10
2,Unclear Requirements,"User stories are vague (e.g., 'as an admin I want to manage users'). Features lack context or acceptance criteria. Ambiguous technical specifications exist.",Product Owner,Developers,Testers,UX/UI Designer,10
3,Frequent Backlog Grooming with High Stakes,Grooming sessions feel pressured due to impending deadlines or perceived urgency from management/sponsors.,Scrum Master,Team Members,Product Owner (during specific times),7
4,Complex User Stories,Stories require multiple steps, involve intricate domain logic, or lack sufficient detail for technical breakdown and planning.,Developers,Testers,UX/UI Designer,9
5,Timeboxing Constraints,"Tasks like testing complex features are underestimated during estimation. Team members feel rushed to fit work into short timeboxes.",Team Members (especially Developers),Scrum Master,6-7
6,Huge Batch Sizes,Receiving and working on very large feature increments or high-volume tasks overwhelms capacity.,Developers,Testers,Product Owner,9
7,Detailed Task Breakdown Pressure,Facing unusually detailed task breakdown requests from management that demand excessive documentation/analysis.,Team Members (especially Product Owners),Scrum Master,6-7
8,Estimation Difficulties,"Lack of historical data or experience with certain types of work makes estimation unreliable. Facing constant re-estimations.",Developers,Team Members,Product Owner,8
9,Emergency Changes/Spikes,Sudden changes to the plan due to urgent fixes or technical spikes force reprioritization and break flow.,Team Members,Scrum Master,5-6
10,Meeting Fatigue,Frequent meetings (Planning, Daily, Retrospective) without clear purpose or adherence to time-boxing cause mental exhaustion.,All Team Members,Product Owner,8-9 (Daily highest)
11,Lack of Sprint Goal Alignment,"Team members don't understand the sprint goal. It feels like working on disconnected tasks with unclear direction.",Developers,Testers,Scrum Master,7
12,Rapidly Changing Priorities,Constant reprioritization due to new urgent demands from Product Owner or external factors.,All Team Members (especially Developers),Product Owner,8-9
13,Technical Decisions Burden,Team members feel pressure taking on too many technical decisions outside their defined areas during planning/execution.,Developers,Scrum Master,7
14,Feature Toggles Misuse,"Excessive use of feature toggles makes it hard to track which code belongs to what feature. Increases cognitive load for debugging/testing.",Developers,Testers,8
15,Conflicting Feedback Sources,Receiving contradictory feedback from Product Owner, QA team, stakeholders during development.,All Team Members (especially Developers),Product Owner,7-8
16,Sudden Technical Direction Changes,Major shifts in technical approach or requirements mid-sprint due to new information or architectural discoveries.,Developers,Team Members,Scrum Master,9
17,Poor Definition of "Done",Vague or inconsistently applied definition leads to ambiguity about when work is truly finished and ready for release.,All Team Members (especially Developers),Product Owner,7-8
18,"Constant Monitoring/Reporting"Pressure from management requiring immediate responses to queries during sprint execution or frequent status reporting mid-sprint.,"Team members feel interrupted by constant requests for details or urgent fixes.",Developers,Team Members,Scrum Master,8-9 (during active development)
19,Understaffed Sprint Teams,Team has less capacity than planned work requires, leading to longer working hours and higher individual pressure.,All Team Members,Product Owner,9
20,Complex Integration Points,Features require complex interactions with existing legacy systems or third-party services.,"Increases the cognitive load needed for technical design and debugging.",Developers,Scrum Master,8-9
