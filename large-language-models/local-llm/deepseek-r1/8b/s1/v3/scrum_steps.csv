ID,Step,Description,Interval,Result
Vision & Goal,"Establishing the high-level vision, goals, target users, market needs, scope boundaries, and initial product roadmap." ,Initial Setup to Sprint Planning,Defined Product Vision: Clear understanding of what the software aims to achieve for whom and why.
Project of Doom,"Detailed planning before the first sprint. This includes requirements gathering (if needed), defining high-level features/epics, setting up development environment, infrastructure, core technical architecture, estimating initial work." ,Before First Sprint Begins,Initial Plan & Setup: Well-defined scope for early sprints; necessary tools and environments ready.
Product Backlog Creation,"Defining the desired product capabilities and functions through user stories or other requirements. Prioritizing these items by value and effort (or simply value)." ,Ongoing during Vision/Goal setting and Project of Doom.,Prioritized Product Backlog: The foundation for sprint planning, containing all known work to be done.
Sprint Planning,"Team meeting where the development team commits to delivering a specific Increment from the prioritized Product Backlog. They break down selected backlog items into tasks." ,End of Sprint / Start of new Sprint,Commitment & Task Breakdown: Development Team commits to Sprint goal and scope; detailed plan for the sprint.
Daily Scrum,"A 15-minute daily stand-up meeting where team members synchronize activities and plan the next 24 hours. Typically held at the same time each day." ,Every calendar day during a Sprint,Team Coordination & Next-Day Plan: Ensures alignment and addresses immediate roadblocks early.
Sprint Execution,"Developing, testing, and refining the product increment throughout the sprint according to the pre-defined plan." ,During the Sprint (variable duration),Potentially Shippable Increment: Work progresses towards completing committed tasks; transparency is maintained.
Backlog Refinement,"Regular meeting (often during Daily Scrum) where Product Owner and Development Team groom the Product Backlog items, breaking them down further if needed for upcoming sprints." ,Ongoing throughout Sprints.,Improved Product Backlog: Items are sized appropriately and ready for sprint planning.
Sprint Review,"Meeting at the end of each Sprint to inspect the Increment and gather feedback. The team demonstrates the work done (if appropriate) and discusses what was accomplished, changes to the plan/forecast." ,End of Sprint,Feedback & Adaptation: Team presents potentially valuable work; stakeholders provide input for future sprints.
Sprint Retrospective,"Meeting at the end of each Sprint where the Scrum Team inspects their own working processes without reference to people or external matters. They discuss how to improve in upcoming sprints." ,End of Sprint,Process Improvement Plan: Identifies areas for improvement within the team and SCRUM practices themselves.
Next Sprint Planning,"Formal meeting held after the Sprint Review/Retrospective where the next set(s) of Product Backlog Items are selected/scheduled into one or more Sprints based on feedback and priorities." ,End of Sprint / Start of new Sprint,New Sprint Commitment: Determines the work for the subsequent sprint.
Development Cycle/Sprint,"The core iterative unit in SCRUM. A dedicated period (typically 1-4 weeks) where specific functionality is developed towards the product goal." ,Variable duration per Sprint,Daily Progress & Increment Completion: Consistent short-cycle development and delivery of value; opportunities for feedback and course correction mid-cycle.
Release Planning, "Coordinating multiple Sprints to deliver a significant version or major release. This involves planning how many sprints are needed (e.g., defining the Release Goal).",Variable duration preceeding/leading Sprints(s),Defined Release Timeline & Goals: Groups related work; ensures alignment across multiple Sprints.
Acceptance Testing,"Validating that the developed increment meets user requirements and is ready for release. This typically includes User Acceptance Testing (UAT) or System Acceptance Testing." ,Occurs during the final phase before a planned release date.,Verified Product Functionality & Readiness: Confirms the Increment satisfies business needs; validates it's fit for purpose.
Release Pipeline/Deployment,"The process of preparing the software increment, testing it thoroughly in staging environments mirroring production, building the release package, and deploying it to production." ,Runs periodically (e.g., after each Release Goal is met or as planned),Successful Production Deployment: New version available to end-users; infrastructure updated.
Release Monitoring & Support,"Activities performed post-release regarding the Increment. This includes ongoing maintenance for bugs found by users, monitoring system performance in the field, gathering user feedback on the released product." ,Ongoing after deployment (longer than typical Sprints),Stable Production System: Ensures long-term viability and success of the shipped software.
Product Owner Refinement,"The Product Owner continues refining backlog items throughout development cycles to adjust priorities based on market changes or emerging needs." ,Continuous,Dynamic Prioritization & Clarification: Keeps the Product Backlog relevant and well-defined for development teams adapting to change.
Scrum Master Servant Leadership,"The Scrum Master facilitates the team by removing impediments, coaching the team in SCRUM practices, helping with process improvement (as per Retrospectives), and protecting the team from external interference." ,Ongoing throughout all phases,Sustained Team Performance & Adherence: Ensures smooth operation of SCRUM events; fosters a productive and collaborative environment.
Continuous Integration (CI),"Developing code frequently (often multiple times a day) and integrating it with others' code. Automated builds and tests are run to detect integration errors quickly." ,Multiple times per Sprint or more frequently.,Early Defect Detection & Reliable Builds: Prevents integration surprises; ensures the main branch has working, tested code.
Automated Testing,"Running automated unit, component, and smoke tests after every build (part of CI) to verify functionality before manual testing starts or to prevent regression." ,Runs with every Continuous Integration build,Regression Prevention & Quality Assurance: Catches bugs early; speeds up integration cycles.
Release Candidate Stabilization,"A period focusing on fixing critical bugs and ensuring stability *before* formally releasing. This might involve a 'longer' Sprint (or part of one) dedicated to final polish." ,Variable duration before planned release.,Critical Bug Fixes & Final Readiness: Ensures the software is stable, performant, and meets quality standards for production deployment.
Post-Mortem/Release Retrospective,"Reviewing how well the team performed during the development phase leading up to the release (if not part of a general Sprint Retrospective)." ,After Release or periodically.,Improvement Insights: Captures lessons learned from successful delivery; informs future process improvements.
