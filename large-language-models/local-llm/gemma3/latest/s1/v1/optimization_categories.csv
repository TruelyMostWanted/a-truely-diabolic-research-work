1,Linear Programming,LP,A problem where the objective function and constraints are all linear.  It's the most common and well-studied type.  Solved using the Simplex method or other linear methods.,Highly Solvable,A company wants to maximize profit based on production levels of multiple products, subject to constraints on resources like labor and materials.,10
2,Integer Programming,IP,A variant of Linear Programming where some or all variables must be integers.  More complex than LP.,Solvable (often NP-hard),A scheduling problem where the number of workers assigned to each task must be a whole number.,8
3,Nonlinear Programming,NLP,A problem where the objective function or constraints (or both) are nonlinear.  Solution methods can be more complex.,Solvable (often difficult),Maximizing a yield function in chemical engineering, where the yield is a nonlinear function of temperature and pressure.,7
4,Dynamic Programming,DP,A technique for solving optimization problems by breaking them down into smaller, overlapping subproblems and storing the solutions to these subproblems to avoid recomputation. Usually used for sequential decision making.,Solvable (with careful design),Finding the optimal route for a delivery truck considering travel times at different times of day.,6
5,Stochastic Programming,SP,A type of optimization problem that deals with uncertainty in the parameters of the problem (e.g., demand, costs).  Solutions often involve scenarios and probabilities.,Solvable (often simulation-based),A manufacturer trying to decide how much to produce, considering uncertain future demand.,5
6,Robust Optimization,RO, A technique for optimization problems where the parameters are uncertain, but the optimization is performed to satisfy certain performance guarantees, regardless of the specific parameter values.,Solvable (often simulation-based),Designing a bridge that can withstand a range of environmental conditions.,4
7,Convex Optimization,CO, A problem where the objective function and feasible region are convex. This guarantees that any local optimum is also a global optimum.,Highly Solvable,Many machine learning problems (e.g., linear regression, support vector machines).,3
8,Quadratic Programming,QP,A problem where the objective function is quadratic and the constraints are linear.,Solvable,Portfolio optimization where the investor wants to maximize return subject to a budget and risk constraints.,2
9,Knapsack Problem,KP, A classic problem where you have a set of items, each with a weight and a value, and you want to select a subset of items to maximize the total value while staying within a weight capacity.,Solvable (often NP-hard),Packing items into a backpack to maximize the total value without exceeding the weight limit.,1
10,Portfolio Optimization,PO, A type of problem where the objective is to find the optimal mix of assets that maximize returns while minimizing risk, typically in finance.,Solvable (often simulation-based),Determining the best asset allocation for a stock portfolio, balancing risk and potential returns.,1
