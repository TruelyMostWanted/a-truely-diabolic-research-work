1,Linear Programming,LP,Problem where we maximize or minimize a function subject to a set of linear constraints. Often used for resource allocation, production planning, etc.
2,Integer Programming,IP,Problem where you need to find the best values for a set of variables, subject to certain constraints, requiring integer solutions.
3,Nonlinear Programming,NLP,Problem where functions are not linear, and you need to find the solution that satisfies the objective function with a non-linear form of the constraint.
4,Dynamic Programming,DP,A problem where the solution is constructed by breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and solving them to find the optimal solution.
5,Constraint Programming,CP,A type of problem where you define a set of constraints that must be satisfied. The solution can be found through trying different combinations of variables that satisfy the constraints.
6,Genetic Algorithms,GA,An evolutionary algorithm that utilizes techniques inspired by biological evolution to find optimal solutions to complex problems.
7,Simulated Annealing,SA,A probabilistic optimization technique that uses a process of accepting worse solutions in a probabilistic way to escape local optima.
8,Particle Swarm Optimization,PSO,A swarm intelligence algorithm where a group of particles automatically seek to a solution and cooperate with each other to achieve an optimal solution.
9,Branch and Bound,BB,A technique to find the optimum solution by systematically exploring the solution space, pruning the search space to eliminate unpromising branches.
10,Gradient Descent,GD,A widely used optimization algorithm that iteratively adjusts a parameter (the "gradient") towards a minimum of the objective function.
