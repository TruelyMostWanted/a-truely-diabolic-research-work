1,Linear Programming,LP,Maximize a linear objective function subject to linear constraints.
2,Quadratic Programming,QP,Maximize or minimize a quadratic objective function subject to linear constraints involving quadratic functions.
3,Integer Programming,IP,Maximize or minimize a function subject to a set of integer variables.
4,Nonlinear Programming,NP,Maximize or minimize a function subject to nonlinear constraints and/or objectives.
5,Dynamic Programming,DP,Break down a complex problem into smaller, overlapping subproblems, solving each subproblem once and storing its solution.
6,Genetic Algorithms,GA,Use principles of natural selection to find the optimal solution. Employs a population of candidate solutions that evolve over time.
7,Simulated Annealing,SA,A metaheuristic optimization algorithm that works by iteratively accepting improvements to a solution and occasionally accepting worse solutions, allowing the algorithm to escape local optima.
8,Constraint Satisfaction Problems,CSP,Define a set of variables and constraints that must be satisfied.
9,Convex Optimization,CO,Algorithms that guarantee the optimal solution within a given bound. (The algorithm is convex)
10,Multi-Objective Optimization,MOO,Optimize multiple objectives simultaneously, aiming to find a compromise between them.
