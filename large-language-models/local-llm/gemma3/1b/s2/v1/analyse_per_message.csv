Based on Entities.csv and Relationships.csv - Proceed and Create 3 individual CSV code-blocks (alternative: files) in chat named: Goals.csv + Conditions.csv + DecisionVariables.csv
Goals.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,IsSum,GoalType,EntityName,EntityAttribute,CriteriaType,Weight""
Conditions.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,IsSum,GoalType,EntityName,EntityAttribute,CriteriaType,Weight""
DecisionVariables.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,DataType,Domain,MinValue,MaxValue""

The following conventions must be applied:
ID starts with a letter G(oals), C(onditions), D(ecision)V(ariables) and a number follows, starting at 0, 1, 2, ....
Name is written snake_case
Names for Goals must begin with ""maximize_"" or ""minimize_""
IsSum is a boolean { True, False }
GoalType is one of { ""min"", ""max"" }
EntityName is always only 1 entry from the ""Name"" of Entities.csv
EntityAttribute is one of the values in the ""Attribute0"" to ""Attribute8"" of the targeted Entity in Entities.csv
CriteriaType is a number { 2 = Must-Match, 1 = May-Match, 0 = Cannot-Match }
Domain can represent set of values like ""{0,1}""
MinValue is the smallest value that can be set
MaxValue is the highest value that can be set
Weight is a mulptlier

**Important Considerations & Next Steps:**

*   **Data Volumes:** The file sizes of the CSV files are a good starting point.  You might need to adjust the number of entries based on your actual data.
*   **Data Consistency:** Ensure that the 'CriteriaType' values are consistently applied across all files.
*   **Data Validation:** Implement data validation checks within your scripts to catch errors.
*   **Tooling:**  Consider using tools like Spreadsheet Editors, or a Data Frame library to build and manage the data effectively.


This provides a solid foundation for your data structures. Let me know if you'd like help with specific scripting tasks to populate these files."

**Understanding the Data & Assumption**

*   **Entities:** These are the items being optimized for. We'll assume a basic structure - we need a way to represent the entities and their properties.
*   **Relations:** These are the relationships between entities. This is a core part of the model - we need to define how the entities relate to each other.
*   **Goals:** Each goal represents a specific objective we want to optimize.
*   **Conditions:** These define constraints that must be satisfied.
*   **DecisionVariables:** These are the variables we'll control to influence the optimization.

**Explanation and LaTeX Code Breakdown**

1.  **`\documentclass{article}`**:  Standard document class.
2.  **`\usepackage{amsmath}`**:  For mathematical symbols.
3.  **`\usepackage{geometry}`**: For page size and margins.
4.  **`\geometry{a4paper, margin=1in}`**: Sets the paper size to A4 and a margin of 1 inch on all sides.
5.  **`\title{...}`**:  The title of the document.
6.  **`\author{...}`**:  The author's name.
7.  **`\date{\today}`**:  The current date.
8.  **`\tableofcontents`**:  Generates the table of contents.
9.  **`\section{...}`**: Defines sections for organization.
10. **`\subsection{...}`**: Defines subsections within each section.
11. **`\label{sec1_1}`**: Creates a label so references can be used.
12. **`\label{sec2_1}`**, **`\label{sec3_1}`**, **`\label{sec4_1}`**, **`\label{sec5_1}`**: Creates labels for each section in the table of contents.
13. **`\begin{itemize}`**:  Starts an itemized list.
14. **`\item{...}`**: Defines an item in the list.
15. **`\label{sec1_1}`**: Label for the first item
16. **`\end{itemize}`**: Ends the itemized list.
17. **`\end{section}`**: Ends a section.
18. **`\end{document}`**:  Completes the document.

**Important Notes and Customization**

*   **CSV Structure:** This LaTeX code assumes a relatively straightforward CSV structure.  If your CSV has a different format (e.g., a specific column order or data types), you'll need to adjust the `\label` references and potentially modify the data within the `\item` text.
*   **Data Integration:** The code needs to be *integrated* with the actual CSV data. You'll replace the placeholders with the correct data.
*   **Mathematical Representation:** The core of the optimization model is the mathematical representation of the goals, conditions, and decision variables. I've provided placeholder values.  You'll need to translate these into equations.

**How to use this:**

1.  **Save as `.tex` file:** Save the code as a `.tex` file (e.g., `optimization_model.tex`).
2.  **Compile:** Use a LaTeX compiler (like pdflatex) to compile the file: `pdflatex optimization_model.tex`. This will generate a PDF file containing the document with the LaTeX code.
3.  **Adapt and Expand:** Modify the code to fit the precise data and logic of your CSV file.

**To help me refine the code further, please provide:**

*   The actual CSV data (as a text file or a snippet).
*   A sample of the data you want to work with.
*   The specific mathematical representation you want to use for the goals, conditions, and decision variables.  For example, are there mathematical expressions you want to evaluate?
*   The desired output format (e.g., a specific style of LaTeX, additional visual elements)."

Please provide the CSV data. I need the text content of the CSV file to be able to create the graph.

Once you paste the CSV data, I will:

1.  **Parse the CSV:**  I'll assume a basic format (columns are likely to be structured data) and attempt to understand the relationships.
2.  **Generate the Mermaid code:** I'll use the TD syntax (see example below) to create the graph.
3.  **Colorize:** I'll use your instructions to color the elements as requested.
4.  **Present the Graph:** I'll give you the Mermaid code, which you can copy and paste into your editor to view the graph.

**Example - Assuming a Simple CSV Structure**

Let's *pretend* you have a CSV like this:

```csv
Entity,Attribute1,Attribute2,Relation,Goal,Condition,DecisionVariable
ProductA,Price,Cost,HigherPrice,Profit,Margin,Profit
ProductB,Price,Cost,LowerPrice,Profit,Margin,Profit
ProductA,Quantity,100,IncreaseQuantity,Sales,Target,Sales
ProductB,Quantity,50,IncreaseQuantity,Sales,Target,Sales
```

Here's the Mermaid code I'll generate (based on that example):

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Entity] --> B{Attribute1};
    B --> C{Attribute2};
    C --> D[Relation];
    D --> E[Goal];
    D --> F[Condition];
    F --> G[DecisionVariable];

    A --> H[Entity];

```

**Now, please paste your CSV data here so I can generate the graph for *your* specific data.**  I'll tailor the code to the structure of *your* data.  The more data you provide, the better I can understand and create the graph."
