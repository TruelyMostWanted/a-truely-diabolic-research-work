\section{Optimization Model}

\subsection{Objective Function}
The objective is to maximize the total profit.  The profit function is defined as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $Profit_1 = Profit_1$
    \item $Profit_2 = Profit_2$
    \item $Profit_3 = Profit_3$
    \item $Profit_4 = Profit_4$
    \item $Profit_5 = Profit_5$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Constraints}

We define several constraints to ensure the model is internally consistent.  The constraints are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Inventory Constraints:} The inventory cost per unit of product must be less than or equal to the production cost.
    \item \textbf{Quantity Constraints:}  The quantity of each product produced must be less than or equal to its initial inventory level.
    \item \textbf{Profit Constraints:} The total profit must equal or exceed the target profit.
\end{itemize}
