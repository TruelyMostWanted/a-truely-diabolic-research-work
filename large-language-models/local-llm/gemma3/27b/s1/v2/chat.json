The optimization *must* satisfy these goals.  Failure to do so is unacceptable.\n*   **Can-Match (🟡 - CriteriaType 1):** These are desirable goals.  The optimization should strive to achieve them, but it's acceptable if they are not fully met as long as the 'Must-Match' goals are satisfied.\n*   **Cannot-Match (🔴 - CriteriaType 0):** These are conditions that *must not* occur.  The optimization should actively prevent these situations.\n\n**Rationale for the chosen goals:**\n\n*   **Maximizing Team Velocity** and **Minimizing Blockers** are standard goals in Scrum for improving productivity.\n*   **Ensuring Requirement Traceability** is vital for quality and understanding the impact of changes.\n*   **Maintaining Consistent Sprint Goals** ensures alignment with overall project objectives.\n*   **Avoiding Skill Gaps** prevents delays and the need for expensive training.\n*   **Preventing Overcommitment** avoids burnout and ensures realistic sprint planning.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nNow that we have defined the goals and conditions, we can move on to:\n\n1.  **Defining Decision Variables:** What can the optimization *control*? (e.g., Task assignments, Sprint Backlog selection).\n2.  **Formulating Constraints:** Mathematical expressions representing the relationships between the variables and the goals/conditions.\n3.  **Defining an Objective Function:** A mathematical expression representing what we want to maximize or minimize (e.g., Team Velocity, Cost).\n\nDo you want me to proceed with defining the decision variables, constraints, and objective function, or would you like me to refine the goals further?",

Decision Variables:**\n\n*   `x_et`: Binary variable. 1 if Employee `e` is assigned to Task `t`, 0 otherwise.\n*   `y_us`: Binary variable. 1 if User Story `u` is selected for a Sprint, 0 otherwise.\n*   `z_es`:  Numeric variable.

A complete representation of *all* constraints and relationships would be extremely complex and difficult to visualize.\n*   **Color Coding:** The code includes the class definitions with the requested colors.\n*   **Directional Arrows:** Arrows represent the direction of influence or connection.\n*   **Subgraphs:** I've used subgraphs to group related entities, variables, goals, and constraints.\n*   **Relationships:**  The `relationship` class is used for general connections and influences between elements.\n*   **Complexity:**  Even this simplified graph is reasonably complex. You may need to zoom in and pan around to see all the details.\n*   **Iterative Refinement:** This is a starting point. You may need to adjust the graph based on your specific needs and the level of detail you want to include.\n\nThis Mermaid.js graph provides a visual representation of the optimization model, highlighting the key entities, variables, goals, and constraints.  It's a helpful tool for understanding the structure of the model and how the different elements interact.",

The optimization should actively prevent these situations.\n\n**Rationale for the chosen goals:**\n\n*   **Maximizing Team Velocity** and **Minimizing Blockers** are standard goals in Scrum for improving productivity.\n*   **Ensuring Requirement Traceability** is vital for quality and understanding the impact of changes.\n*   **Maintaining Consistent Sprint Goals** ensures alignment with overall project objectives.\n*   **Avoiding Skill Gaps** prevents delays and the need for expensive training.\n*   **Preventing Overcommitment** avoids burnout and ensures realistic sprint planning.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nNow that we have defined the goals and conditions, we can move on to:\n\n1.  **Defining Decision Variables:** What can the optimization *control*?

The combined effort on skills must be within the employee's total time.\n    ```\n    ∑(s ∈ S) z_es ≤ 1   ∀ e ∈ E\n    ```\n\n**b) Sprint Planning Constraints:**\n\n*   Sprint capacity limit. The total estimated effort of selected User Stories must not exceed the sprint capacity.\n    ```\n    ∑(u ∈ U) y_us * (est_u + p_us) ≤ cap_s   ∀ Sp ∈ Sp\n    ```\n\n**c) Requirement Traceability (Must-Match Goal):**\n\n*   All User Stories selected for a sprint must be linked to a Feature and Project.\n    ```\n    y_us = req_u  ∀ u ∈ U\n    ```\n\n**d) Skill Gap Constraint (Avoid Skill Gaps Goal):**\n\n*   Ensure that available skills meet the demands of the selected User Stories.  (This is a complex constraint and might need further refinement based on specific skill requirements of each User Story).\n    ```\n    ∑(e ∈ E) z_es ≥ SkillRequirement(u)   ∀ u ∈ U\n    ```\n\n**e) Overcommitment Prevention (Prevent Overcommitment Goal):**\n\n*   Employee's total assigned effort should not exceed their capacity.\n    ```\n    ∑(t ∈ T) x_et +  ∑(u ∈ U) x_et  ≤ EmployeeCapacity(e)  ∀ e ∈ E\n    ```\n\n**f) Binary and Non-Negativity Constraints:**\n\n*   `x_et ∈ {0, 1}`\n*   `y_us ∈ {0, 1}`\n*   `z_es ≥ 0`\n*   `p_us ≥ 0`\n\n**6. Goals encoded as Constraints and Objective Function:**\n\n*   **Maximize Team Velocity:** Reflected in the objective function by maximizing the value of delivered features.\n*   **Minimize Blockers:** Add a penalty term to the objective function for unresolved blockers.\n*   **Consistent Sprint Goals:** Can be implemented via constraint that links the sprint goals to project objectives.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   This is a simplified representation and needs further refinement based on the specific details of the software development process.\n*   The constraints enforce the limitations and rules of the system.\n*   The objective function defines what we are trying to optimize.\n*   The decision variables represent the choices we can make to achieve our goals.\n\n**Further Refinements:**\n\n*   This model can be extended to include more complex factors, such as risk, cost, and quality.\n*   The constraints can be adjusted to reflect the specific requirements of the project.\n*   The objective function can be modified to incorporate multiple objectives.\n\nThis provides a comprehensive mathematical representation of the optimization problem. This model can be implemented and solved using optimization solvers such as Gurobi, CPLEX, or open-source solvers like GLPK.",

A complete representation of *all* constraints and relationships would be extremely complex and difficult to visualize.\n*   **Color Coding:** The code includes the class definitions with the requested colors.\n*   **Directional Arrows:** Arrows represent the direction of influence or connection.\n*   **Subgraphs:** I've used subgraphs to group related entities, variables, goals, and constraints.\n*   **Relationships:**  The `relationship` class is used for general connections and influences between elements.\n*   **Complexity:**  Even this simplified graph is reasonably complex. You may need to zoom in and pan around to see all the details.\n*   **Iterative Refinement:** This is a starting point. You may need to adjust the graph based on your specific needs and the level of detail you want to include.\n\nThis Mermaid.js graph provides a visual representation of the optimization model, highlighting the key entities, variables, goals, and constraints.  It's a helpful tool for understanding the structure of the model and how the different elements interact.",
