1,Linear Programming,LP,"Optimization problems where the objective function and constraints are linear. Aims to maximize or minimize a linear function subject to linear equality and inequality constraints.",Often solvable in polynomial time (efficient algorithms exist),Maximizing profit with limited resources.,10
2,Integer Programming,IP,"Similar to LP, but requires some or all variables to be integers. Adds complexity.",NP-hard (generally hard to solve, but heuristics and specialized algorithms exist),Assigning tasks to workers with binary (0 or 1) variables.,8
3,Convex Optimization,CO,"Optimization problems where the objective function and constraint set are convex. Guarantees a global optimum.",Often solvable efficiently (especially with interior-point methods),Support Vector Machines (SVMs),7
4,Dynamic Programming,DP,"Breaking down a complex problem into smaller overlapping subproblems, solving each subproblem only once, and storing the solutions to avoid redundant computation.",Solvable if the subproblems have optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems,Shortest path problems, route planning,6
5,Combinatorial Optimization,CO,"Problems dealing with discrete structures (combinations, permutations, graphs). Often involves finding the 'best' object from a finite set.",NP-hard in many cases; uses heuristics, genetic algorithms, simulated annealing,Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP),5
6,Nonlinear Programming,NLP,"Optimization problems where the objective function or constraints are nonlinear.",Can be challenging; local optima are a concern; many different algorithms apply.,Portfolio optimization with complex constraints,4
7,Mixed-Integer Programming,MIP,"Combines linear, integer, and nonlinear elements. Very general and powerful.",NP-hard, often requires specialized solvers.,Supply chain optimization,3
