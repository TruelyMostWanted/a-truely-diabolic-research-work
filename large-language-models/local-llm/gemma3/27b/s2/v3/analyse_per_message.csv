Based on Entities.csv and Relationships.csv - Proceed and Create 3 individual CSV code-blocks (alternative: files) in chat named: Goals.csv + Conditions.csv + DecisionVariables.csv
Goals.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,IsSum,GoalType,EntityName,EntityAttribute,CriteriaType,Weight""
Conditions.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,IsSum,GoalType,EntityName,EntityAttribute,CriteriaType,Weight""
DecisionVariables.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,DataType,Domain,MinValue,MaxValue""

The following conventions must be applied:
ID starts with a letter G(oals), C(onditions), D(ecision)V(ariables) and a number follows, starting at 0, 1, 2, ....
Name is written snake_case
Names for Goals must begin with ""maximize_"" or ""minimize_""
IsSum is a boolean { True, False }
GoalType is one of { ""min"", ""max"" }
EntityName is always only 1 entry from the ""Name"" of Entities.csv
EntityAttribute is one of the values in the ""Attribute0"" to ""Attribute8"" of the targeted Entity in Entities.csv
CriteriaType is a number { 2 = Must-Match, 1 = May-Match, 0 = Cannot-Match }
Domain can represent set of values like ""{0,1}""
MinValue is the smallest value that can be set
MaxValue is the highest value that can be set
Weight is a mulptlier
Created 10 to 15 entries in each of these files."

CSV data for Entities, Relations, Goals, Conditions, and DecisionVariables. I'll create the structure you requested with a title page, table of contents, and the five sections.  Because I don't have the actual CSV data at this moment I will populate these with placeholder data. The code will be formatted to be easily replaced with the real data.

**Important Assumptions and Notes:**

*   **CSV Data Representation:** I'm assuming the CSV data provides information like:
    *   **Entities:** Name, Type (e.g., Machine, Material, Operator)
    *   **Relations:** Entity1, Entity2, Relation Type (e.g., ""Machine A uses Material B"")
    *   **Goals:** ID, Name, Description, Mathematical Expression (e.g., ""Minimize Cost"", ""Maximize Throughput"")
    *   **Conditions:** ID, Name, Description, Mathematical Expression (e.g., ""Capacity Limit"", ""Demand Fulfillment"")
    *   **DecisionVariables:** Name, Type (e.g., Continuous, Binary), Lower Bound, Upper Bound
*   **Mathematical Notation:** I'll use standard optimization notation.  You'll likely need to adjust this based on the specific nature of your model.
*   **Placeholders:**  I'm using placeholders like ""Entity1"", ""Variable1"", etc.  Replace these with the actual entity/variable names and appropriate mathematical expressions.
*   **Model Complexity:** The complexity of the mathematical model will be dictated by the relationships in your data. I'm providing a basic framework you'll expand upon.

**How to use this code:**

1.  **Save:** Save the code as a `.tex` file (e.g., `optimization_model.tex`).
2.  **Compile:** Use a LaTeX compiler (like TeX Live, MiKTeX, or Overleaf) to compile the `.tex` file into a PDF.
3.  **Replace Placeholders:**  Carefully replace the placeholder data (Entities, Indices, Goal/Condition expressions, Decision Variables) with the actual data from your CSV files.
4. **Adjust:** Refine the mathematical formulation based on the specific relationships and constraints in your optimization problem.  Add more Goals, Conditions, and Decision Variables as needed.
5.  **Check:**  Always review the generated PDF to ensure that the mathematical notation is correct and the model is formulated as intended.

Let me know if you'd like me to help refine any specific part of this code or provide more guidance on the mathematical modeling process."

**First, I need the CSV data!**  Please provide the data for:

*   **Entities** (Entity Name)
*   **Attributes** (Attribute Name, Entity Name)
*   **Relations** (Entity1, Entity2, Relation Type)
*   **Goals** (Goal Name, Entity/Attribute)
*   **Conditions** (Condition Name, Entity/Attribute)
*   **DecisionVariables** (DecisionVariable, Entity)

Once you provide that data, I will:

1.  **Process the data** to structure it for graph creation.
2.  **Generate the Mermaid.js code** using the `graph TD` syntax, following your connection and colorization rules:
    *   Entities: Blue
    *   Attributes: White
    *   Relations: Orange
    *   Goals: Green
    *   Conditions: Red
    *   Decision Variables: Purple
3.  **Present the Mermaid.js code to you.**  You can then copy and paste it into the [Mermaid.js Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/) to visualize the graph.

**Example Data Structure (to illustrate what I need):**

**Entities:**

```csv
Entity Name
Customer
Product
Order
```

**Attributes:**

```csv
Attribute Name,Entity Name
CustomerID,Customer
Name,Customer
ProductID,Product
Price,Product
OrderID,Order
Quantity,Order
```

**Relations:**

```csv
Entity1,Entity2,Relation Type
Customer,Order,Places
Order,Product,Contains

**Goals:**

```csv
Goal Name,Entity/Attribute
MaximizeRevenue,Product.Price
IncreaseCustomerSatisfaction,Customer.Name

**Conditions:**

```csv
Condition Name,Entity/Attribute
HighDemand,Product.Price
LowStock,Product.ProductID
```

**DecisionVariables:**

```csv

**Waiting for Your Data!**  I'll do my best to create a clear and informative graph once I receive it.  I'll prioritize readability, even if it results in a more complex graph with more connections.  Let me know if you have any specific preferences."
