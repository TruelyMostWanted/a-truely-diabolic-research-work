You *must* replace the placeholder variables (e.g., `w_k`, `c_i`, `Availability_i`) with the actual numerical data from your CSV files.\n*   **Function Definitions:** The `s_k = f(z_k)` relationship (success score as a function of effort) needs to be defined explicitly.  The exact function will depend on how effort translates into success in your model.\n*   **Objective Function:**  You may want to combine the goals into a single objective function with weights. This would require defining how to trade off between maximizing success, minimizing cost, and maximizing ROI.\n*   **Solver Compatibility:**  This is a general mathematical model.  The specific format will need to be adapted for use with a specific optimization solver (e.g., CPLEX, Gurobi, CBC).\n*   **Constraints:** You may need to add additional constraints based on the specific requirements of your problem.\n*   **Error Checking:** Verify the correctness of the mathematical formulas and ensure that the units of measurement are consistent.\n\n**To Use This Code:**\n\n1.  Save the code as a `.tex` file (e.g., `optimization_model.tex`).\n2.  Compile the file using a LaTeX compiler (e.g., `pdflatex optimization_model.tex`).  This will generate a PDF document containing the optimization model.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to help you with any of these steps, such as defining the objective function or adding more constraints.  I can also help you adapt the code for a specific solver if you tell me which one you're using.\n"
