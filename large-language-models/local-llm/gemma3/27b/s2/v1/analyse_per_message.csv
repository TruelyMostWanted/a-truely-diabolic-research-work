Based on Entities.csv and Relationships.csv - Proceed and Create 3 individual CSV code-blocks (alternative: files) in chat named: Goals.csv + Conditions.csv + DecisionVariables.csv
Goals.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,IsSum,GoalType,EntityName,EntityAttribute,CriteriaType,Weight""
Conditions.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,IsSum,GoalType,EntityName,EntityAttribute,CriteriaType,Weight""
DecisionVariables.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,DataType,Domain,MinValue,MaxValue""

The following conventions must be applied:
ID starts with a letter G(oals), C(onditions), D(ecision)V(ariables) and a number follows, starting at 0, 1, 2, ....
Name is written snake_case
Names for Goals must begin with ""maximize_"" or ""minimize_""
IsSum is a boolean { True, False }
GoalType is one of { ""min"", ""max"" }
EntityName is always only 1 entry from the ""Name"" of Entities.csv
EntityAttribute is one of the values in the ""Attribute0"" to ""Attribute8"" of the targeted Entity in Entities.csv
CriteriaType is a number { 2 = Must-Match, 1 = May-Match, 0 = Cannot-Match }
Domain can represent set of values like ""{0,1}""
MinValue is the smallest value that can be set
MaxValue is the highest value that can be set
Weight is a mulptlier
Created 10 to 15 entries in each of these files."

    \item $z_k$:  Integer variable: Level of effort allocated to project $k$ (e.g., 1-5, representing low to high effort).
    \item $s_k$: Success score of project $k$ (Continuous, between 0 and 1).  This might be a function of $z_k$ (e.g.  $s_k = f(z_k)$).

**Important Considerations and Next Steps:**

*   **Data Integration:**  This code provides the *structure*. You *must* replace the placeholder variables (e.g., `w_k`, `c_i`, `Availability_i`) with the actual numerical data from your CSV files.
*   **Function Definitions:** The `s_k = f(z_k)` relationship (success score as a function of effort) needs to be defined explicitly.  The exact function will depend on how effort translates into success in your model.
*   **Objective Function:**  You may want to combine the goals into a single objective function with weights. This would require defining how to trade off between maximizing success, minimizing cost, and maximizing ROI.
*   **Solver Compatibility:**  This is a general mathematical model.  The specific format will need to be adapted for use with a specific optimization solver (e.g., CPLEX, Gurobi, CBC).
*   **Constraints:** You may need to add additional constraints based on the specific requirements of your problem.
*   **Error Checking:** Verify the correctness of the mathematical formulas and ensure that the units of measurement are consistent.

**To Use This Code:**

1.  Save the code as a `.tex` file (e.g., `optimization_model.tex`).
2.  Compile the file using a LaTeX compiler (e.g., `pdflatex optimization_model.tex`).  This will generate a PDF document containing the optimization model.

Let me know if you'd like me to help you with any of these steps, such as defining the objective function or adding more constraints.  I can also help you adapt the code for a specific solver if you tell me which one you're using."
