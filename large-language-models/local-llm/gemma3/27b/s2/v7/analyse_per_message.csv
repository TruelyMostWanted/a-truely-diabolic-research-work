Based on Entities.csv and Relationships.csv - Proceed and Create 3 individual CSV code-blocks (alternative: files) in chat named: Goals.csv + Conditions.csv + DecisionVariables.csv
Goals.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,IsSum,GoalType,EntityName,EntityAttribute,CriteriaType,Weight""
Conditions.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,IsSum,GoalType,EntityName,EntityAttribute,CriteriaType,Weight""
DecisionVariables.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,DataType,Domain,MinValue,MaxValue""

The following conventions must be applied:
ID starts with a letter G(oals), C(onditions), D(ecision)V(ariables) and a number follows, starting at 0, 1, 2, ....
Name is written snake_case
Names for Goals must begin with ""maximize_"" or ""minimize_""
IsSum is a boolean { True, False }
GoalType is one of { ""min"", ""max"" }
EntityName is always only 1 entry from the ""Name"" of Entities.csv
EntityAttribute is one of the values in the ""Attribute0"" to ""Attribute8"" of the targeted Entity in Entities.csv
CriteriaType is a number { 2 = Must-Match, 1 = May-Match, 0 = Cannot-Match }
Domain can represent set of values like ""{0,1}""
MinValue is the smallest value that can be set
MaxValue is the highest value that can be set
Weight is a mulptlier

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

*   **LaTeX Structure:** The code is well-structured with a title, author, date, table of contents, and the requested sections.  It uses appropriate LaTeX commands for mathematical notation and itemized lists.
*   **Sets, Indices, Goals, Conditions, Decision Variables:** These are defined clearly, providing a foundation for the optimization model.
*   **Mathematical Representation:**  The equations are written using `amsmath` for proper formatting.
*   **Logical Representation:**  A clear English description accompanies each mathematical representation to explain its meaning.
*   **Data Integration:** The information from the provided CSVs is integrated into these definitions.
*   **Assumptions:** Because the original data was limited, some assumptions were necessary (e.g., ranges for stakeholder satisfaction). You should refine these assumptions based on more specific data.
*   **Objective Function:** The multiple goals (G1, G2, G3) can be combined into a single objective function using weights to represent their relative importance.  For example:
    ```latex
    \max \omega_1 \sum_{p \in P} \sum_{l \in L} \text{Price}_p \cdot \text{Production}_{p,l,t} - \omega_2 \sum_{l \in L} \text{PollutionLevel}_l \cdot \text{ActivityScale}_l + \omega_3 \sum_{s \in S} \text{WelfareGain}_s \cdot \text{StakeholderSatisfaction}_s
    ```
    Where $\omega_1$, $\omega_2$, and $\omega_3$ are weights representing the importance of each goal.
*   **Solver:** This is a general optimization model. To solve it, you would need to use an optimization solver (e.g., Gurobi, CPLEX, SciPy) and provide the specific data for all the parameters (prices, resource capacities, demand, pollution levels, welfare gains, etc.).
*   **Complexity:**  The complexity of the model will depend on the number of entities, indices, and the specific relationships between them.  For large-scale problems, you might need to consider decomposition techniques or approximation algorithms.

This LaTeX code provides a solid foundation for your optimization model. Remember to adapt it based on your specific data and requirements. Let me know if you would like any modifications or further elaboration."

*   **Conditions** (Condition ID, Entity ID or Attribute ID, Condition Description)
*   **DecisionVariables** (DecisionVariable ID, Entity ID, DecisionVariable Description)

**Once you provide the data, I'll:**

1.  Parse the CSV data.
2.  Construct the Mermaid.js graph TD syntax string.
3.  Apply the requested colorization.
4.  Present the completed Mermaid.js code.  You can then copy and paste this code directly into the [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/) to render the graph.

DecisionVariables:

502,2,Order Fulfillment Strategy
```

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Data Format:**  Ensure the CSV data is consistently formatted with commas as delimiters and headers.
*   **Entity/Attribute IDs:** The IDs are crucial for linking.  Make sure they match across the CSV files.
*   **Graph Complexity:**  A very large amount of data may result in a complex and difficult-to-read graph. I'll do my best to generate a reasonable visualization, but you may need to simplify the data or use different visualization techniques for very large datasets.
*   **Multiple Connections:** The code will handle multiple attributes and relations per entity, creating multiple connections in the graph.

**I'm waiting for your CSV data!**  Let's create that graph!"
