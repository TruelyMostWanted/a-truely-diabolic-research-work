Based on Entities.csv and Relationships.csv - Proceed and Create 3 individual CSV code-blocks (alternative: files) in chat named: Goals.csv + Conditions.csv + DecisionVariables.csv
Goals.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,IsSum,GoalType,EntityName,EntityAttribute,CriteriaType,Weight""
Conditions.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,IsSum,GoalType,EntityName,EntityAttribute,CriteriaType,Weight""
DecisionVariables.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,DataType,Domain,MinValue,MaxValue""

The following conventions must be applied:
ID starts with a letter G(oals), C(onditions), D(ecision)V(ariables) and a number follows, starting at 0, 1, 2, ....
Name is written snake_case
Names for Goals must begin with ""maximize_"" or ""minimize_""
IsSum is a boolean { True, False }
GoalType is one of { ""min"", ""max"" }
EntityName is always only 1 entry from the ""Name"" of Entities.csv
EntityAttribute is one of the values in the ""Attribute0"" to ""Attribute8"" of the targeted Entity in Entities.csv
CriteriaType is a number { 2 = Must-Match, 1 = May-Match, 0 = Cannot-Match }
Domain can represent set of values like ""{0,1}""
MinValue is the smallest value that can be set
MaxValue is the highest value that can be set
Weight is a mulptlier

*   **Conditions:** (Constraints on the model - e.g., Production capacity limits, Resource availability, Worker skill matching, Demand requirements)
*   **Decision Variables:** (The things the model can change to achieve the goals - e.g., Quantity of product produced at each location, Assignment of workers to tasks)

    \item $P$: Set of Products.  (e.g., $\{P_1, P_2, \dots, P_n\}$)
    \item $L$: Set of Locations. (e.g., $\{L_1, L_2, \dots, L_m\}$)
    \item $R$: Set of Resources. (e.g., $\{R_1, R_2, \dots, R_k\}$)

**Explanation and How to Use:**

1.  **Save as `.tex`:** Save the above code as a file named `optimization_model.tex`.

2.  **Compile with LaTeX:**  You'll need a LaTeX distribution (like MiKTeX, TeX Live, or MacTeX) installed on your computer.  Compile the `.tex` file using a LaTeX compiler (e.g., `pdflatex optimization_model.tex`).  This will generate a PDF document.

3.  **Adapt to Your Data:**
    *   **Entities, Indices:** Adjust the entity sets and indices based on your specific entities and how you are indexing them.
    *   **Goals:** Replace the example goals with your actual goals.  Add more goals if needed. Make sure the mathematical representation accurately reflects the goal.
    *   **Conditions:**  Replace the example conditions with your actual constraints.  Add more constraints if needed.  The mathematical representation must be correct.
    *   **Decision Variables:** Define your decision variables accurately.  Include any non-negativity constraints (e.g., `x_{ij} \geq 0`).

4.  **Parameters:**  The code assumes you'll define the parameters (like `p_{ij}` for profit, `c_{ij}` for cost, `Capacity_{j}`, `Resource_{k}`, `Demand_{i}`) elsewhere in your model. These are the inputs to the optimization problem.  You might want to add a section for defining these parameters.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Model Complexity:**  This is a simplified example.  Real-world optimization models can be much more complex.
*   **Solver:** To actually *solve* this optimization problem, you'll need an optimization solver (like Gurobi, CPLEX, or an open-source solver like CBC).  You'll need to use a modeling language (like Pyomo, AMPL, or GAMS) to express the model in a format that the solver can understand.

This LaTeX code provides a clear and organized representation of your optimization model, suitable for documentation, reporting, or sharing with others. Remember to tailor it to your specific problem and data.  Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points or help you with more complex modeling aspects."

**Instructions:**

1.  **Paste your CSV data:** Replace the example CSV data with your actual data.
2.  **Verify CSV Format:**  **Crucially, confirm that the format of your CSV data matches my assumptions.**  If not, tell me the correct structure, and I'll adjust the code.
3.  **Copy and Paste:** Copy the Mermaid.js code above.
4.  **Mermaid Live Editor:**  Go to the Mermaid Live Editor: [https://mermaid.live/](https://mermaid.live/)
5.  **Paste:** Paste the Mermaid.js code into the editor. The graph should automatically render.

I'm ready to help you refine this once you provide your CSV data and confirm the format!  I will adjust the code accordingly."
