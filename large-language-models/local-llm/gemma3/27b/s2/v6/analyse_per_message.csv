Based on Entities.csv and Relationships.csv - Proceed and Create 3 individual CSV code-blocks (alternative: files) in chat named: Goals.csv + Conditions.csv + DecisionVariables.csv
Goals.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,IsSum,GoalType,EntityName,EntityAttribute,CriteriaType,Weight""
Conditions.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,IsSum,GoalType,EntityName,EntityAttribute,CriteriaType,Weight""
DecisionVariables.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,DataType,Domain,MinValue,MaxValue""

The following conventions must be applied:
ID starts with a letter G(oals), C(onditions), D(ecision)V(ariables) and a number follows, starting at 0, 1, 2, ....
Name is written snake_case
Names for Goals must begin with ""maximize_"" or ""minimize_""
IsSum is a boolean { True, False }
GoalType is one of { ""min"", ""max"" }
EntityName is always only 1 entry from the ""Name"" of Entities.csv
EntityAttribute is one of the values in the ""Attribute0"" to ""Attribute8"" of the targeted Entity in Entities.csv
CriteriaType is a number { 2 = Must-Match, 1 = May-Match, 0 = Cannot-Match }
Domain can represent set of values like ""{0,1}""
MinValue is the smallest value that can be set
MaxValue is the highest value that can be set
Weight is a mulptlier
Created 10 to 15 entries in each of these files."

**Explanation and Assumptions:**

*   **Entities:** The `Entities` CSV provides the foundational elements of the problem: Projects, Resources, Skills, and Teams.
*   **Indices:** These provide a way to iterate through the sets in the mathematical representation.
*   **Goals:** I've defined three goals: maximizing project completion, minimizing total cost, and maximizing resource utilization.  You'll likely need to define weights or priorities for these goals in a real-world implementation (e.g., using a weighted sum approach in a multi-objective optimization).
*   **Conditions:**
    *   **SkillMatch:**  This ensures that resources assigned to a project have the necessary skills.
    *   **ResourceLimit:**  This enforces the availability of each resource.
    *   **BudgetLimit:** This enforces the budget constraints for each project.
    *   **CompletionDependency:** This adds the condition that the project needs to have enough resources assigned to it to complete the project.
*   **DecisionVariables:** These are the variables that the optimization model will determine to achieve the goals while satisfying the conditions.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Data from CSV:**  This LaTeX code represents the *structure* of the optimization model. You'll need to populate the constants (e.g., `b_j`, `d_i`, costs `c_ij`) with data from your CSV files.
*   **Solver:**  This is a mathematical programming model. You'll need to use an appropriate optimization solver (e.g., Gurobi, CPLEX, or an open-source solver like CBC) to solve the model and find the optimal values for the decision variables.
*   **Complexity:** The complexity of the model can grow quickly with the number of projects, resources, skills, and teams.
*   **Multi-objective Optimization:** If you have multiple conflicting goals, you might consider using multi-objective optimization techniques to find a set of Pareto-optimal solutions.
*   **Assumptions:** I've made some assumptions about the relationships between the entities. Review these assumptions carefully to ensure they accurately reflect the real-world problem you are trying to solve.

This code provides a solid starting point for building your optimization model. Remember to adapt and refine it based on your specific needs and the data available in your CSV files."

Please provide the CSV data for:

*   **Entities**

*   **Goals**

I'll then process this data and output a Mermaid.js graph definition (using `graph TD` syntax) that visualizes the connections and color-coding as you've requested.

**Important Considerations & How I'll Handle Things:**

*   **Data Format:** I'm assuming CSV data will be in a relatively simple format.  For example:
    *   **Entities:** `EntityID,EntityName`
    *   **Attributes:** `AttributeID,EntityID,AttributeName,AttributeValue` (or similar)
    *   **Relations:** `RelationID,Entity1ID,Entity2ID,RelationType`
    *   **Goals:** `GoalID,EntityID/AttributeID,GoalDescription` (Will need to clarify which it applies to)
    *   **Conditions:** `ConditionID,EntityID/AttributeID,ConditionDescription` (Will need to clarify which it applies to)
    *   **DecisionVariables:** `DecisionVariableID,EntityID,Description`

*   **Multiple Attributes:**  I'll position attributes around the entity they belong to, potentially using multiple placement nodes to avoid overlapping lines.

*   **Ambiguity:** If there's ambiguity in which Entity/Attribute a Goal/Condition/DecisionVariable relates to, please clarify in your CSV data, or I'll make a reasonable guess based on the data structure.

*   **Graph Complexity:**  A very large amount of data might result in a complex, potentially unreadable graph.  I'll try to optimize for clarity, but it's possible some simplification will be needed.

*   **Error Handling:** I'll attempt to handle basic CSV parsing errors, but providing well-formatted data will greatly improve the results.

**Once you paste the CSV data, I'll generate the Mermaid.js code.**  Let's begin!"
