Based on Entities.csv and Relationships.csv - Proceed and Create 3 individual CSV code-blocks (alternative: files) in chat named: Goals.csv + Conditions.csv + DecisionVariables.csv
Goals.csv must have the following header: "ID,Name,Description,IsSum,GoalType,EntityName,EntityAttribute,CriteriaType,Weight"
Conditions.csv must have the following header: "ID,Name,Description,IsSum,GoalType,EntityName,EntityAttribute,CriteriaType,Weight"
DecisionVariables.csv must have the following header: "ID,Name,Description,DataType,Domain,MinValue,MaxValue"

The following conventions must be applied:
ID starts with a letter G(oals), C(onditions), D(ecision)V(ariables) and a number follows, starting at 0, 1, 2, ....
Name is written snake_case
Names for Goals must begin with "maximize_" or "minimize_"
IsSum is a boolean { True, False }
GoalType is one of { "min", "max" }
EntityName is always only 1 entry from the "Name" of Entities.csv
EntityAttribute is one of the values in the "Attribute0" to "Attribute8" of the targeted Entity in Entities.csv
CriteriaType is a number { 2 = Must-Match, 1 = May-Match, 0 = Cannot-Match }
Domain can represent set of values like "{0,1}"
MinValue is the smallest value that can be set
MaxValue is the highest value that can be set
Weight is a mulptlier
Created 10 to 15 entries in each of these files.

USER:
Use ALL of the previously provided and generated CSV data (Entities, Relations, Goals, Conditions, DecisionVariables) and formulate the optimization model mathematically and logically. 
Write it into a code-block for a LaTeX (.tex) file and provide the generated Latex code in chat.
The file consists of a introduction page with Title, Author, Date and Table of Contents.
The actual file contest consists of 5 different \sections labeled "1. Sets (Entities)", "2. Indices", "3. Goals", "4. Conditions", "5. DecisionVariables"
The items of each category are itemized between \begin and \end.
Goals and Conditions show both their IDs, Names and the logical and mathematical representation

ASSISTANT:
Okay, let's craft the LaTeX code for the optimization model document based on the provided CSV data (Entities, Relations, Goals, Conditions, DecisionVariables).  I'll follow your structure with the introduction page, table of contents, and the five sections you requested.  I'll represent the goals and conditions with both IDs, names, and logical/mathematical representations.

Here's the LaTeX code.  I'll provide it as a single code block, ready to copy and paste into a `.tex` file.  I've made assumptions where necessary, particularly in the relationships between entities, and have tried to represent the data as faithfully as possible.

    \item \textbf{Logical Representation}:  Maximize the sum of values generated by completed projects.
    \item \textbf{Mathematical Representation}: $\max \sum_{k \in P} V_k \cdot x_k$ where $x_k$ is a binary variable indicating if project k is completed, and $V_k$ is the value of project k.

    \item \textbf{Goal ID}: G2
    \item \textbf{Goal Name}: Minimize Total Cost
    \item \textbf{Logical Representation}:  Minimize the sum of costs associated with resource consumption.

    \item \textbf{Mathematical Representation}: $\sum_{j \in T} r_{ij} \cdot z_{ij} \le A_i  \quad \forall i \in R$, where $r_{ij}$ is the amount of resource $i$ used by task $j$, $z_{ij}$ is a binary variable indicating if task $j$ is performed, and $A_i$ is the available amount of resource $i$.

    \item \textbf{Condition ID}: C2
    \item \textbf{Condition Name}: Task Dependencies
    \item \textbf{Logical Representation}: Some tasks cannot start until others are finished.

    \item \textbf{Condition ID}: C3
    \item \textbf{Condition Name}: Project Requirements
    \item \textbf{Logical Representation}:  Each project requires a specific set of tasks to be performed.
    \item \textbf{Mathematical Representation}:  If project $k$ is completed ($x_k = 1$), then all required tasks for that project must be performed:  $x_k \le \sum_{j \in T_k} z_{ij}$, where $T_k$ is the set of tasks required for project k.

\end{itemize}

\section{5. DecisionVariables}

\end{itemize}

**Explanation and Important Notes:**

*   **LaTeX Packages:** I've included `amsmath` for mathematical notation, `geometry` to set page margins, and `hyperref` for creating clickable links in the PDF output (e.g., in the Table of Contents).
*   **Mathematical Notation:** I've used standard mathematical symbols and formatting where appropriate.
*   **Goal/Condition Representation:** The goals and conditions are presented with their IDs, names, logical explanations, and mathematical formulations.  I have attempted to accurately reflect the relationships between entities based on your input.
*   **Decision Variables:** I've clearly defined the decision variables and their types (binary, continuous).
*   **Assumptions:**  I made assumptions about the relationships between tasks, projects, and resources, and the specific structure of the optimization problem. You'll need to refine these based on your specific application.
*   **Compilation:** To generate a PDF document, save this code as a `.tex` file (e.g., `optimization_model.tex`) and compile it using a LaTeX compiler (like `pdflatex`).
*   **Customization:**  Feel free to adjust the document's formatting, add more details, and refine the mathematical model to fit your specific requirements.
*   **Relationships:** The relationships within the conditions (e.g., task dependencies, project requirements) may need to be refined to accurately reflect the constraints of your specific problem.  The "relations" data was not directly integrated into the mathematical formulation due to lack of specificity.
*   **Complete Model:** This provides a framework. A fully functional optimization model would require defining all parameters (costs, values, available amounts, deadlines, etc.) and specifying the objective function and all constraints.
*   **Variables:** I defined the primary decision variables and you'll likely need to add additional auxiliary variables or modify them depending on the complexity of your actual problem.

USER:
Transform all of the provided and generated CSV data (Entities, Attributes, Relations, Goals, Conditions, DecisionVariables) into a graph using the Mermaid.js Live Editor graph TD syntax.
Connect...
- Entities with their Attributes and place the Attributes around the Entities they belong to. (can exist multiple times in the graph to make lines less short)
- Entities with their Relations
- Goals with the Entity/Attributes
- Conditions with the Entity/Attributes
- DecisionVariables with their relevant Entities

Colorize...
- Entities in blue
- Attributes in white
- Relations in orange
- Goals in green
- Conditions in red
- Decision Variables in purple

ASSISTANT:
Okay, I'm ready to transform the CSV data into a Mermaid.js graph.  **Please provide the CSV data for Entities, Attributes, Relations, Goals, Conditions, and DecisionVariables.**

Once you provide the data, I will:

1.  **Parse the CSV data:**  I'll interpret the CSV strings to understand the relationships.
2.  **Generate Mermaid Code:** I'll construct a Mermaid graph definition using the `graph TD` syntax, following your instructions for connections and colors.
3.  **Present the Mermaid Code:** I'll output the code block you can copy and paste into the Mermaid.js Live Editor ([https://mermaid.live/](https://mermaid.live/)).

**Example of the data format I expect:**

*   **Entities:**
    ```csv
    EntityID,EntityName
    1,Customer
    2,Order
    3,Product
    ```

*   **Attributes:**
    ```csv
    AttributeID,EntityID,AttributeName
    1,1,CustomerID
    2,1,Name
    3,2,OrderID
    4,2,OrderDate
    5,3,ProductID
    6,3,Price
    ```

*   **Relations:**
    ```csv
    RelationID,SourceEntityID,TargetEntityID,RelationType
    1,1,2,Places
    2,2,3,Contains
    ```

*   **Goals:**
    ```csv
    GoalID,TargetEntityType,TargetAttribute
    1,1,Name
    2,2,OrderDate
    ```

*   **Conditions:**
    ```csv
    ConditionID,TargetEntityType,TargetAttribute,ConditionValue
    1,1,Name,John
    2,2,OrderDate,2023-10-26
    ```

*   **DecisionVariables:**
    ```csv
    DecisionVariableID,EntityID
    1,1
    2,2
    ```

**Important:**

*   I'll assume the IDs are integers and can be used to link the data.
*   The clearer you make the CSV data, the better the resulting graph will be.
*   I'll try to handle multiple connections appropriately to avoid a cluttered graph.
*   I'll do my best to create a visually readable graph, but complex relationships might still lead to a moderately complex diagram.

**Waiting for your CSV data!  Please paste it here.**
