The model includes:

1. **Entities.csv**: This file defines the various entities in the domain model, including their attributes. Entities range from high-level concepts like `Project` and `Team` to more granular elements like `User Story`, `Task / Sub-Task`, and `Blocker / Problem / Bug`. Each entity is described with its attributes, which detail the properties and characteristics of the entity.

2. **Relationships.csv**: This file outlines the relationships between the entities defined in the Entities.csv file. It specifies how entities are connected to each other, including the cardinality of the relationships (e.g., one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many). Relationships include assignments, memberships, and various forms of containment and association.

These structures provide a comprehensive framework for modeling the key components and interactions within a SCRUM-based software development environment. The entities and their relationships help in understanding the roles, processes, and artifacts involved in the development lifecycle."
