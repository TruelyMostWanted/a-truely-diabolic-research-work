Here’s how NLP can be integrated into the SCRUM framework:

### **How NLP Enhances SCRUM:**
1. **Requirement Extraction:**
   - NLP can parse unstructured text (e.g., user stories, emails, or meeting notes) to identify key requirements.
   - It can detect entities like actors, actions, and constraints, helping in structuring requirements.

2. **Structuring Requirements:**
   - NLP can classify requirements into categories (functional, non-functional, technical debt, etc.).
   - It can also link requirements to relevant SCRUM artifacts (e.g., user stories, backlog items).

3. **Complexity Evaluation:**
   - NLP can analyze the linguistic complexity of requirements (e.g., length, ambiguity, technical terms) to estimate effort.
   - It can flag unclear or incomplete requirements for refinement.

4. **Automated Backlog Management:**
   - NLP can suggest prioritization based on keyword frequency, urgency, or business impact.
   - It can also detect dependencies between requirements.

### **CSV File with NLP-Relevant Keywords for SCRUM:**

These can be categorized into several areas:

1. **Process-Related Factors**:
   - **Tight Deadlines**: Frequent pressure to meet sprint goals within short timeframes.
   - **Unclear Requirements**: Ambiguity in user stories or acceptance criteria leading to uncertainty.
   - **Excessive Meetings**: Too many Scrum ceremonies (e.g., daily stand-ups, sprint planning, retrospectives) consuming development time.

2. **Team Dynamics**:
   - **Interpersonal Conflicts**: Tensions or misunderstandings among team members.
   - **Role Ambiguity**: Unclear responsibilities or overlapping roles causing confusion.
   - **High Workload**: Individual team members taking on too much work due to poor task distribution.

3. **Technical Factors**:
   - **Technical Debt**: Accumulation of unresolved technical issues leading to increased complexity.
   - **Tooling Issues**: Inefficient or poorly integrated development tools.
   - **Frequent Changes**: Last-minute changes in requirements or priorities.

4. **Organizational Factors**:
   - **Lack of Support**: Insufficient resources or support from management.
   - **High Expectations**: Unrealistic expectations from stakeholders.
   - **Micromanagement**: Excessive oversight or control from managers.

5. **External Factors**:
   - **Market Pressure**: Competitive pressures influencing project priorities.
   - **Customer Demands**: Frequent and unpredictable customer requests.
