Based on Entities.csv and Relationships.csv - Proceed and Create 3 individual CSV code-blocks (alternative: files) in chat named: Goals.csv + Conditions.csv + DecisionVariables.csv
Goals.csv must have the following header: "ID,Name,Description,IsSum,GoalType,EntityName,EntityAttribute,CriteriaType,Weight"
Conditions.csv must have the following header: "ID,Name,Description,IsSum,GoalType,EntityName,EntityAttribute,CriteriaType,Weight"
DecisionVariables.csv must have the following header: "ID,Name,Description,DataType,Domain,MinValue,MaxValue"

The following conventions must be applied:
ID starts with a letter G(oals), C(onditions), D(ecision)V(ariables) and a number follows, starting at 0, 1, 2, ....
Name is written snake_case
Names for Goals must begin with "maximize_" or "minimize_"
IsSum is a boolean { True, False }
GoalType is one of { "min", "max" }
EntityName is always only 1 entry from the "Name" of Entities.csv
EntityAttribute is one of the values in the "Attribute0" to "Attribute8" of the targeted Entity in Entities.csv
CriteriaType is a number { 2 = Must-Match, 1 = May-Match, 0 = Cannot-Match }
Domain can represent set of values like "{0,1}"
MinValue is the smallest value that can be set
MaxValue is the highest value that can be set
Weight is a mulptlier
Created 10 to 15 entries in each of these files.

Use ALL of the previously provided and generated CSV data (Entities, Relations, Goals, Conditions, DecisionVariables) and formulate the optimization model mathematically and logically. 
Write it into a code-block for a LaTeX (.tex) file and provide the generated Latex code in chat.
The file consists of a introduction page with Title, Author, Date and Table of Contents.
The actual file contest consists of 5 different \sections labeled "1. Sets (Entities)", "2. Indices", "3. Goals", "4. Conditions", "5. DecisionVariables"
The items of each category are itemized between \begin and \end.
Goals and Conditions show both their IDs, Names and the logical and mathematical representation

Transform all of the provided and generated CSV data (Entities, Attributes, Relations, Goals, Conditions, DecisionVariables) into a graph using the Mermaid.js Live Editor graph TD syntax.
Connect...
- Entities with their Attributes and place the Attributes around the Entities they belong to. (can exist multiple times in the graph to make lines less short)
- Entities with their Relations
- Goals with the Entity/Attributes
- Conditions with the Entity/Attributes
- DecisionVariables with their relevant Entities

Colorize...
- Entities in blue
- Attributes in white
- Relations in orange
- Goals in green
- Conditions in red
- Decision Variables in purple

Provide all 5 code-blocks (files) in chat:
3 Comma-Seperated-Values (csv), 1 LaTeX (tex), 1 Mermaid (mmd)

ASSISTANT:
I'll create the requested files one by one. Let's start with the CSV files.
