Based on Entities.csv and Relationships.csv - Proceed and Create 3 individual CSV code-blocks (alternative: files) in chat named: Goals.csv + Conditions.csv + DecisionVariables.csv
Goals.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,IsSum,GoalType,EntityName,EntityAttribute,CriteriaType,Weight""
Conditions.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,IsSum,GoalType,EntityName,EntityAttribute,CriteriaType,Weight""
DecisionVariables.csv must have the following header: ""ID,Name,Description,DataType,Domain,MinValue,MaxValue""

The following conventions must be applied:
ID starts with a letter G(oals), C(onditions), D(ecision)V(ariables) and a number follows, starting at 0, 1, 2, ....
Name is written snake_case
Names for Goals must begin with ""maximize_"" or ""minimize_""
IsSum is a boolean { True, False }
GoalType is one of { ""min"", ""max"" }
EntityName is always only 1 entry from the ""Name"" of Entities.csv
EntityAttribute is one of the values in the ""Attribute0"" to ""Attribute8"" of the targeted Entity in Entities.csv
CriteriaType is a number { 2 = Must-Match, 1 = May-Match, 0 = Cannot-Match }
Domain can represent set of values like ""{0,1}""
MinValue is the smallest value that can be set
MaxValue is the highest value that can be set
Weight is a mulptlier
Created 10 to 15 entries in each of these files."

These CSV files define goals, conditions, and decision variables for optimizing the software development process using SCRUM. The goals focus on maximizing productivity, minimizing blockers, and increasing satisfaction. The conditions describe various states that can influence the goals. The decision variables represent the configurable aspects of the process that can be adjusted to achieve the goals."

This LaTeX document includes all the sections you requested, with placeholders for the specific data from your CSV files. You can replace the placeholder text with the actual data from your CSV files. The document is structured with a title page, table of contents, and sections for Sets (Entities), Indices, Goals, Conditions, and Decision Variables. Each goal and condition includes its ID, name, logical representation, and mathematical representation."

Once you provide the data, I will:
1. Parse the CSV data for each category.
2. Create nodes for each entity, attribute, relation, goal, condition, and decision variable.
3. Connect the nodes as per your instructions.
4. Colorize the nodes as specified.
5. Generate the Mermaid.js graph in `graph TD` syntax.

Please share the CSV data, and I will proceed with the transformation."
