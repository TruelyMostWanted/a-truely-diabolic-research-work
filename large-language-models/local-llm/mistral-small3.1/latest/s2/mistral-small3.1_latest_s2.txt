Based on Entities.csv and Relationships.csv - Proceed and Create 3 individual CSV code-blocks (alternative: files) in chat named: Goals.csv + Conditions.csv + DecisionVariables.csv
Goals.csv must have the following header: "ID,Name,Description,IsSum,GoalType,EntityName,EntityAttribute,CriteriaType,Weight"
Conditions.csv must have the following header: "ID,Name,Description,IsSum,GoalType,EntityName,EntityAttribute,CriteriaType,Weight"
DecisionVariables.csv must have the following header: "ID,Name,Description,DataType,Domain,MinValue,MaxValue"

The following conventions must be applied:
ID starts with a letter G(oals), C(onditions), D(ecision)V(ariables) and a number follows, starting at 0, 1, 2, ....
Name is written snake_case
Names for Goals must begin with "maximize_" or "minimize_"
IsSum is a boolean { True, False }
GoalType is one of { "min", "max" }
EntityName is always only 1 entry from the "Name" of Entities.csv
EntityAttribute is one of the values in the "Attribute0" to "Attribute8" of the targeted Entity in Entities.csv
CriteriaType is a number { 2 = Must-Match, 1 = May-Match, 0 = Cannot-Match }
Domain can represent set of values like "{0,1}"
MinValue is the smallest value that can be set
MaxValue is the highest value that can be set
Weight is a mulptlier
Created 10 to 15 entries in each of these files.

USER:
Use ALL of the previously provided and generated CSV data (Entities, Relations, Goals, Conditions, DecisionVariables) and formulate the optimization model mathematically and logically. 
Write it into a code-block for a LaTeX (.tex) file and provide the generated Latex code in chat.
The file consists of a introduction page with Title, Author, Date and Table of Contents.
The actual file contest consists of 5 different \sections labeled "1. Sets (Entities)", "2. Indices", "3. Goals", "4. Conditions", "5. DecisionVariables"
The items of each category are itemized between \begin and \end.
Goals and Conditions show both their IDs, Names and the logical and mathematical representation

ASSISTANT:
Sure, I can help you formulate the optimization model based on the provided data. Since I don't have the actual data, I'll create a generic structure for you. You can replace the placeholders with your actual data.

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\usepackage{enumitem}

\title{Optimization Model}
\author{Your Name}
\date{\today}

\begin{document}

\maketitle
\tableofcontents

\section{Sets (Entities)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Entity1}: Description of Entity1.
    \item \textbf{Entity2}: Description of Entity2.
    \item \textbf{Entity3}: Description of Entity3.
\end{itemize}

\section{Indices}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Index1}: Description of Index1.
    \item \textbf{Index2}: Description of Index2.
    \item \textbf{Index3}: Description of Index3.
\end{itemize}

\section{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Goal1 (ID: G1)}: Maximize the total profit.
    \begin{align*}
        \text{Maximize} \quad \sum_{i \in I} P_i x_i
    \end{align*}

    \item \textbf{Goal2 (ID: G2)}: Minimize the total cost.
    \begin{align*}
        \text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{j \in J} C_j y_j
    \end{align*}
\end{itemize}

\section{Conditions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Condition1 (ID: C1)}: Capacity constraint.
    \begin{align*}
        \sum_{i \in I} a_i x_i \leq b
    \end{align*}

    \item \textbf{Condition2 (ID: C2)}: Demand constraint.
    \begin{align*}
        \sum_{j \in J} d_j y_j \geq D
    \end{align*}
\end{itemize}

\section{Decision Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Variable1}: Description of Variable1.
    \begin{align*}
        x_i \geq 0 \quad \forall i \in I
    \end{align*}

    \item \textbf{Variable2}: Description of Variable2.
    \begin{align*}
        y_j \geq 0 \quad \forall j \in J
    \end{align*}
\end{itemize}

\end{document}
```

### Instructions to Use:
1. Replace the placeholders in the `Sets (Entities)`, `Indices`, `Goals`, `Conditions`, and `Decision Variables` sections with your actual data.
2. Ensure that the mathematical representations are accurate and match your specific optimization model.
3. Compile the LaTeX document using a LaTeX editor or an online LaTeX compiler to generate the PDF.

If you provide the actual data, I can help you fill in the specific details.

────────────────────────────
USER:
Transform all of the provided and generated CSV data (Entities, Attributes, Relations, Goals, Conditions, DecisionVariables) into a graph using the Mermaid.js Live Editor graph TD syntax.
Connect...
- Entities with their Attributes and place the Attributes around the Entities they belong to. (can exist multiple times in the graph to make lines less short)
- Entities with their Relations
- Goals with the Entity/Attributes
- Conditions with the Entity/Attributes
- DecisionVariables with their relevant Entities

Colorize...
- Entities in blue
- Attributes in white
- Relations in orange
- Goals in green
- Conditions in red
- Decision Variables in purple

ASSISTANT:
Sure, to transform the provided CSV data into a graph using Mermaid.js Live Editor syntax, we need to follow the structure you've described. Below is a template to get you started. You'll need to replace the placeholders with your actual data.

First, let's assume you have the following CSV data (as an example):

**Entities:**
```
EntityID,EntityName
1,Customer
2,Product
3,Order
```

**Attributes:**
```
AttributeID,AttributeName,EntityID
1,CustomerID,1
2,CustomerName,1
3,ProductID,2
4,ProductName,2
5,OrderID,3
6,OrderDate,3
```

**Relations:**
```
RelationID,RelationName,EntityID1,EntityID2
1,Purchases,1,2
2,Contains,3,2
```

**Goals:**
```
GoalID,GoalName,EntityID,AttributeID
1,MaximizeSales,2,4
2,IncreaseCustomerSatisfaction,1,2
```

**Conditions:**
```
ConditionID,ConditionName,EntityID,AttributeID
1,CustomerAgeOver18,1,1
2,ProductInStock,2,3
```

**DecisionVariables:**
```
DecisionVariableID,DecisionVariableName,EntityID
1,DiscountRate,1
2,PromotionBudget,2
```

Now, let's transform this data into a Mermaid.js graph:

```mermaid
graph TD
    %% Entities
    subgraph Entities
        direction TB
        E1[Customer]::blue
        E2[Product]::blue
        E3[Order]::blue
    end

    %% Attributes
    subgraph Attributes
        direction TB
        A1[CustomerID]::white
        A2[CustomerName]::white
        A3[ProductID]::white
        A4[ProductName]::white
        A5[OrderID]::white
        A6[OrderDate]::white
    end

    %% Relations
    subgraph Relations
        direction TB
        R1[Purchases]::orange
        R2[Contains]::orange
    end

    %% Goals
    subgraph Goals
        direction TB
        G1[MaximizeSales]::green
        G2[IncreaseCustomerSatisfaction]::green
    end

    %% Conditions
    subgraph Conditions
        direction TB
        C1[CustomerAgeOver18]::red
        C2[ProductInStock]::red
    end

    %% Decision Variables
    subgraph DecisionVariables
        direction TB
        DV1[DiscountRate]::purple
        DV2[PromotionBudget]::purple
    end

    %% Connecting Entities with Attributes
    E1 --> A1
    E1 --> A2
    E2 --> A3
    E2 --> A4
    E3 --> A5
    E3 --> A6

    %% Connecting Entities with Relations
    E1 --> R1
    E2 --> R1
    E3 --> R2
    E2 --> R2

    %% Connecting Goals with Entities/Attributes
    G1 --> E2
    G1 --> A4
    G2 --> E1
    G2 --> A2

    %% Connecting Conditions with Entities/Attributes
    C1 --> E1
    C1 --> A1
    C2 --> E2
    C2 --> A3

    %% Connecting Decision Variables with Entities
    DV1 --> E1
    DV2 --> E2
```

This template provides a basic structure. You need to replace the placeholders with your actual data and ensure that all connections are correctly represented. Each subgraph is color-coded as per your instructions.
