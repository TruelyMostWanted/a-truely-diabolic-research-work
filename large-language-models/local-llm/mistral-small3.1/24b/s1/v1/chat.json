Since I don't have access to the actual content of these files, I'll provide a general approach on how to create the CSV with the specified format.\n\n### Step-by-Step Approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Entities and Relationships**:\n   - Review the `Entities.csv` to identify the different types of entities and their attributes.\n   - Review the `Relationships.csv` to understand how these entities are related to each other.\n\n2. **Define the Main Goals**:\n   - Identify the key objectives or goals that need to be achieved.\n   - These goals can be derived from the relationships and attributes of the entities.\n\n3. **Define the Conditions**:\n   - Identify the conditions that must be met for the goals to be achieved.\n   - These conditions can be derived from the relationships and attributes of the entities.\n\n4. **Classify the Criteria Type**:\n   - **Must-Match (2 = 🟢)**: Conditions that are essential for the goal to be achieved.\n   - **Can-Match (1 = 🟡)**: Conditions that are desirable but not essential.\n   - **Cannot-Match (0 = 🔴)**: Conditions that should be avoided.\n\n5. **Create the CSV**:\n   - Ensure there is an equal number of goals in each `CriteriaType`.\n\n### Example CSV Structure:\n\nAssuming we have the following entities and relationships:\n\n- **Entities.csv**:\n  ```\n  ID,Type,Name,Description\n  1,Person,Alice,Software Engineer\n  2,Project,ProjectX,Develop a new software application\n  3,Skill,Java,Programming language\n  4,Skill,Python,Programming language\n  ```\n\n- **Relationships.csv**:\n  ```\n  Entity1ID,Entity2ID,Relationship\n  1,2,WorksOn\n  1,3,HasSkill\n  1,4,HasSkill\n  ```\n\n### Example Goals and Conditions:\n\n1. **Goal**: Assign Alice to ProjectX.\n   - **Condition**: Alice must have the required skills for ProjectX.\n   - **CriteriaType**: Must-Match (2 = 🟢)\n\n2. **Goal**: Ensure Alice has the necessary training.\n   - **Condition**: Alice can attend additional training courses.\n   - **CriteriaType**: Can-Match (1 = 🟡)\n\n3. **Goal**: Avoid assigning Alice to projects she is not qualified for.\n   - **Condition**: Alice should not be assigned to projects requiring skills she does not have.\n   - **CriteriaType**: Cannot-Match (0 = 🔴)\n\n4. **Goal**: Maximize Alice's productivity.\n   - **Condition**: Alice should work on projects that align with her skills.\n   - **CriteriaType**: Must-Match (2 = 🟢)\n\n5. **Goal**: Provide opportunities for skill development.\n   - **Condition**: Alice can be assigned to projects that help her learn new skills.\n   - **CriteriaType**: Can-Match (1 = 🟡)\n\n6. **Goal**: Prevent skill gaps.\n   - **Condition**: Alice should not be assigned to projects requiring skills she lacks.\n   -

Since I don't have access to the actual content of these files, I'll provide a general approach on how to create the CSV with the specified format.\n\n### Step-by-Step Approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Entities and Relationships**:\n   - Review the `Entities.csv` to identify the different types of entities and their attributes.\n   - Review the `Relationships.csv` to understand how these entities are related to each other.\n\n2. **Define the Main Goals**:\n   - Identify the key objectives or goals that need to be achieved.\n   - These goals can be derived from the relationships and attributes of the entities.\n\n3. **Define the Conditions**:\n   - Identify the conditions that must be met for the goals to be achieved.\n   - These conditions can be derived from the relationships and attributes of the entities.\n\n4. **Classify the Criteria Type**:\n   - **Must-Match (2 = 🟢)**: Conditions that are essential for the goal to be achieved.\n   - **Can-Match (1 = 🟡)**: Conditions that are desirable but not essential.\n   - **Cannot-Match (0 = 🔴)**: Conditions that should be avoided.\n\n5. **Create the CSV**:\n   - Ensure there is an equal number of goals in each `CriteriaType`.\n\n### Example CSV Structure:\n\nAssuming we have the following entities and relationships:\n\n- **Entities.csv**:\n  ```\n  ID,Type,Name,Description\n  1,Person,Alice,Software Engineer\n  2,Project,ProjectX,Develop a new software application\n  3,Skill,Java,Programming language\n  4,Skill,Python,Programming language\n  ```\n\n- **Relationships.csv**:\n  ```\n  Entity1ID,Entity2ID,Relationship\n  1,2,WorksOn\n  1,3,HasSkill\n  1,4,HasSkill\n  ```\n\n### Example Goals and Conditions:\n\n1. **Goal**: Assign Alice to ProjectX.\n   - **Condition**: Alice must have the required skills for ProjectX.\n   - **CriteriaType**: Must-Match (2 = 🟢)\n\n2. **Goal**: Ensure Alice has the necessary training.\n   - **Condition**: Alice can attend additional training courses.\n   - **CriteriaType**: Can-Match (1 = 🟡)\n\n3. **Goal**: Avoid assigning Alice to projects she is not qualified for.\n   - **Condition**: Alice should not be assigned to projects requiring skills she does not have.\n   - **CriteriaType**: Cannot-Match (0 = 🔴)\n\n4. **Goal**: Maximize Alice's productivity.\n   - **Condition**: Alice should work on projects that align with her skills.\n   - **CriteriaType**: Must-Match (2 = 🟢)\n\n5. **Goal**: Provide opportunities for skill development.\n   -
